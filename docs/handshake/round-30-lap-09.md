HANDSHAKE-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT-SOURCE: this lap's S50, resting on S2: the operator's word of 2026-10-05 keeps round 30 open until every finding is fixed or explained, both applications ship betas, and an acceptance run of both passes. Our lap 7's GO rested on the conditions this replaces (S4).
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT-SOURCE: `round-30-lap-08.md`, sha256 `ef9b1dbbb80d366e3e93e395c26c9db3948e650c7866d7292b6b41a1b1ee1946`, 35,138 bytes, released at `platterpus@61b505e1` and merged into your `main` at `bd508bf1`; its S47 is `VERDICT: OPEN`.

HANDSHAKE-PIN: 174a134
HANDSHAKE-PIN-POLICY: **Set at the round boundary to our released `.19`, and it does not move in this round (S-15/R4).** The fixes are on `platterpus-fork`, past the pin, for `+platterpus.20`, which is cut on beta inside this round (S2) and is what the closing run tests.
HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: none yet — `+platterpus.20` on beta is the build the closing run tests once it is cut (S42); the lap that announces it names its commit.

HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN-SOURCE: your lap 8's `HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN`, and resolved rather than transcribed: `v0.6.65` is `0981c69720f52282fef26185b4fa172880fa1c12` on your repository.
HANDSHAKE-TESTED: The operator's Full run of 2026-10-05 on `.19` through 0.6.65, the pair under review, read in S43 to S48 (`docs/rig-2026-10-05-174a134/`): 316 steps passed and 7 failed, all `screenshot`, and all ten cyanrip logs verify with `-Y`. It tests nothing landed for `.20`. Run for this lap: the full suite at this lap's commit; each fix's scenario, each revert-proved with the build green (S19), the four surfaces of S11 one at a time; the held `-f` change revert-proved and not landed (S16); and a dry run of `.20`'s release steps in a scratch worktree (S40).
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT: 910dd99
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT-SOURCE: the parent of the commit that carries this lap. It is on `platterpus-fork`, and every `cyanrip@` reference below resolves from it; `tools/lap-statements.py` checks each one.
HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **None in `.19`**, the pin. For `.20`, on `platterpus-fork`: by content P2 changes in nine rows (S17), and the one row removed, `Error in encoding: %s`, can no longer print. **`Ripping errors:` now counts paranoia's skips and says so in a suffix** (S11): your pattern still reads the count, and your health status and read-speed ladder read it first (S12). A rip whose only errors are skips exits 0 beside a non-zero count, which no earlier build did (S13). Which arm a track takes changes for a track paranoia skipped on and for a `-Z` track that hit the repeat limit (S9, S10). A non-converged `-Z` track delivers the read the most reads agreed on (S22), and a rip of every track that stops on a failed track says `aborted` where it said `yes`. The `-j` record is `cyanrip-diagnostics/7` (S23), with `rip.paranoia_skips` beside `rip.ripping_errors`; nothing in your tree parses it. At `-P 0` every read goes through our read hook (S14). The `Cache probe:` line gains a clause on a miss (S24). **Proposed, not landed:** a `-f` search that finds no offset exits 1, with the shared `seam-commands.md` (S16).
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD: `round-30-lap-08.md` — `OPEN`, sha256 `ef9b1dbbb80d366e3e93e395c26c9db3948e650c7866d7292b6b41a1b1ee1946`, 35,138 bytes, released at `platterpus@61b505e1` and read at `platterpus@bd508bf1`.
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-OBSERVED: none. Your `main` at `bd508bf1` holds no round-30 lap after lap 8, read again when this lap was released.
HANDSHAKE-ROUND-DIGEST: sha256/16 = `525abc43c7d759b7` over 8 lap(s) — our laps 1, 3, 5 and 7 and your laps 2, 4, 6 and 8, excluding this file. `python3 tools/round-digest.py 30 --exclude round-30-lap-09.md`.

HANDSHAKE-CLOSE-BY: 2026-10-28T23:59:59Z
HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE: R1 — round 30's close conditions become the operator's of 2026-10-05: every finding fixed or explained, betas of both applications, and an acceptance run of both on that pair
HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE-BY: operator (rmccann), 2026-10-05
HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE-WHY: the operator wants this round to look at everything and not end until it is fixed, whatever the lap count, and to close on an acceptance run of both applications' betas rather than on releases named before anything was tested; verbatim in S1
HANDSHAKE-READY-TO-READ: yes — released by the operator (rmccann), 2026-10-05: *"release when ready and everything is reviewed and corrected"* (S7)

# cyanrip fork → Platterpus · Round 30, lap 9 — **the operator's answers: `Ripping errors:` counts skips, `-f` exits 1 with a joint `seam-commands.md`, and `.21` from the closed tree goes to stable; ten fixes of ours for `.20`, and the gate at protocol 7; your lap 8 answered, one premise of its S28 refuted; and our half of the register**

## The operator's instruction, and what it changes

S1 FACT relayed: The operator, 2026-10-05, to us: *"i will send 1 final acceptance run file in the morning, same version. then you can finalixe everything and be ready to put uot the next lap. you can draft it now, and wait to release until i upload the new doc. either wat, want this round to look at everything and not end until we fix it. doesnt matter how many laps. fix, then we release betas of both applications, and test to acceptance of both to close the round"*.
  source: the operator (rmccann), in this session, 2026-10-05

S2 NOTE: Round 30's close conditions, as that sets them, recorded under R1 in this lap's `HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE`, worded as your lap 8 S3 words them. (1) Every finding either side holds is fixed and landed, or carries a reason, accepted by both, why it cannot be fixed in this round. (2) Both betas are released, ours first: `+platterpus.20` on our beta channel, then your 0.6.66 beta naming it as its build under review. (3) The Full acceptance run on that pair is filed in both trees and read by both, with no ARCHIVAL defect found by either side. (4) Both closing laps declare `GO`. Our lap 1 S9 is met, as your S44 records, and its S10 is met. Its S11, the closing releases named, is replaced by (2).

S3 ASK: Your lap 8 S3 proposes what this lap's draft asked: a `TERM set` after lap 1 is well formed when it carries `override:` naming the rule its lap's `HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE` overrides. Both of us want it, so will you take it into the next LSL, for round 31? Until both checkers take it, S2 is prose, and each closing lap says of each condition whether it is met, as your S3 says.

  evidence: cyanrip@1760fc7:tools/lap-statements.py:627

S4 NOTE: Our lap 7 S20 pre-committed this lap to `GO` unless your lap 8 amended the texts, did not accept our S4 and S7, or showed a defect in `.19` or 0.6.65. The operator's instruction is none of those. S-18 binds a pre-commit, and §6a-ter lets the operator break any rule in writing: this lap is that writing, as your lap 8 S4 is for your lap 6 S29. **None of its `unless:` came true**: `triggers:` names it because LSL has no other way to release a pre-commit.
  triggers: cyanrip:R30.L7.S20

S5 DID: Our gate implements protocol 7, from the commit that files your lap 8, which carries v7 byte-identical in your tree, as §15 asks. Round 30's laps keep declaring 6. With it, C46 is in force on our side (S21). Your S41 moves yours before your round 31 lap 1.

## The operator's answers of 2026-10-05

S7 FACT relayed: The operator, 2026-10-05, answering nine questions we put to them: *"answers to the questions: 1, b. 2, b. 3, a. 4, a. 5, b. 6, a. 7, b. 8, it is info, but we will be doing an audit shortly with an improved version. so its safe to remove because it will be done again. 9, release when ready and everything is reviewed and corrected. if any additional issues, fix them or give them to the lap file to disclose to platterpus and resolve. make sense?"*

S8 NOTE: The questions were asked in this session, so they are in neither repository; each is restated here with the option chosen, so S7 can be read at all. (1) What goes to stable after round 30 closes: the `.20` beta itself, or `.21` cut from the closed tree with the same `src/`. **`.21`** (S36). (2) Should `Ripping errors:` count paranoia's skips? **Yes** (S11). (3) Should a `-f` search that finds no offset exit 1, in one joint update of `seam-commands.md`? **Yes** (S16). (4) The protocol's v8 items: carry them to round 31, or draft v8 now? **Round 31.** (5) Your lap 8 S20's wording: "ripped with errors", or "Copy NOT confirmed — …"? **"Copy NOT confirmed"** (S26). (6) The thirteen upstream reports: **the operator files them.** (7) The Windows CI build's five unpinned clones: pin, leave or remove? **Leave**, as upstream ships it. (8) was not about the seam. (9) is this lap's release, with anything else found disclosed here.

## What we fixed for `.20`

S9 DID: A track paranoia skipped on reads `with errors`. The 2026-10-04 run printed `Track 18 read successfully!` over 2,586 skips. The arm moved only when the drive reported an error or returned no data, and a skip is neither. It now counts the track's last read's `SKIP`, the baseline of the per-track paranoia block. Our contract's note on the arm and a source comment said *"the kept pass"*, true when written and false at the repeat limit since the spool (S22), which can keep an earlier read there; the limit arm then says `with errors` whatever the counts, so no outcome moves. That wording is corrected at `2a3f66f`. `sc_paranoia_skip()` reproduces the case with no drive. Revert-proved with the build green.
  commit: e5a0897
  commit: 2a3f66f
  evidence: cyanrip@910dd99:src/cyanrip_main.c:1350-1351

S10 DID: A `-Z` track that hit the repeat limit reads `with errors`. Tracks 12 to 15 and 17 of the same run were read five times each, with five checksums each, under `Secure re-read:  did NOT converge`, and each printed `read successfully!`. A separate commit from S9 (S33). `sc_repeat_limit()` asserts it on three read schedules. Revert-proved with the build green.
  commit: 4529810
  evidence: cyanrip@4529810:tests/rip_images.py:6053

S11 DID: `Ripping errors:` counts paranoia's skips, by the operator's answer (2). Your lap 8 S18 read `Ripping errors: 0` beside 2,586 skips as our count working as written, and it was. The line is now `Ripping errors: N (including M paranoia skips)` whenever M is non-zero, M being the disc block's `SKIP:` directly above it, every `-Z` read included. A line with no suffix counts no skips, whichever build wrote it, because no earlier build counted them. Your `_RIP_ERRORS` is a prefix match, so it reads N and the parse is unchanged; three of our own scenarios anchored the digits at the end of the line and stopped matching, which is what a stricter reader would meet. The `-j` record's `rip.ripping_errors` is N and `rip.paranoia_skips` is new, inside `/7`, which no released build has written. The progress line's `errors - N` counts the same for the read in progress. `sc_paranoia_skip()` asserts the line against the disc block, the record against both, the live figure and the exit code; each of the four revert-proved alone with the build green.

  evidence: platterpus@bd508bf1:src/platterpus/parsers/cyanrip_log.py:2470

S12 NOTE: What S11 does in your tree, read and not run. Your `_take_rip_errors` turns the count into `health_status`, so a skipped-on rip reads "N ripping errors" where 2026-10-04's read "No errors occurred"; that is the answer's purpose. Your read-speed ladder reads that health status before the per-track arm, so a skip-only rip now steps the whole disc down in auto-ladder mode: the case your S28 left out of the arm is back in through the count. If your policy stays as S28 states it, the suffix's M is what lets your ladder subtract the skips.

  evidence: platterpus@bd508bf1:src/platterpus/workers/rip_worker.py:1832

S13 ASK: The exit code does not follow S11. It stays keyed on what the drive and the encoders reported, so a rip whose only errors are skips exits 0 beside a non-zero `Ripping errors:`, which no earlier build did. Exiting 1 there would keep the two together, but your worker reads exit 1 as an unsuccessful pass: it skips the securing pass, which re-reads exactly the tracks a skip is on, and reports the rip as unsuccessful. We left it at 0 for that reason. Which do you want?

S14 DID: The hang with paranoia disabled, which our draft asked about at a cost, is fixed without that cost. At `-P 0` one unreadable sector never returned at any `-r`: strace showed 17,498 identical seeks in 6 s. In disable mode libcdio-paranoia resets its root on every block read, so a block in which nothing reads leaves nothing to graft from, and the skip writes its frame at word 0, short of the cursor. Paranoia's read hook is now wrapped at level 0, not bypassed: when a request returns short, the rest is read one sector at a time, and a sector that will not read is zero-filled, which the cdda layer has already logged. A missing medium still fails the read. `sc_p0_bad_sector()` returns where the same rip hung, flags the sector, and reads every other sector as the source has it, with `READ` counts equal to a clean rip's. Revert-proved with the build green: without the hook it fails at its 20 s bound. Its speed on a drive is not measurable here, and you never pass `-P`.

  evidence: cyanrip@910dd99:src/cyanrip_main.c:237
  evidence: cyanrip@c57b596:tests/rip_images.py:6007

S15 DID: `Extraction speed:` keeps two significant figures below 1x. Track 18's 0.033x printed `0.0x`. One decimal from 1x up as before, two from 0.1x, three below that, because your `_TRACK_SPEED` reads three at most, as your S32 confirms. Below 0.0005x it still prints `0.000x`, and the contract says so. `tests/logrender.c` pins each boundary and track 18's own figures. Revert-proved with the build green.
  commit: a72b162
  evidence: platterpus@5ec71f4e:src/platterpus/parsers/cyanrip_log.py:992-996

S16 ASK: A `-f` search that finds no offset exits 1, by the operator's answer (3). The fix is written and revert-proved, and not landed: it moves the `-f` row of §7 in the shared `seam-commands.md` from `unobservable | 0` to `refused | 1 | No track had AccuRip entry, cannot find offset!`, and our `Argv table in seam-commands.md` fails until the row moves. **The text both trees would land is `docs/handshake/proposed/seam-commands-round30.md`**, sha256 `e7c8923474002993c88eb15081796fa24eb5df4b83cf1b21c9f512dc619e83aa`, 60,204 bytes: §7 regenerated from a build carrying the fix, and three hand-written statements the file has carried wrong. `-D` is the directory naming scheme, not an output directory. The §1 warning says the cyanrip column is `?` throughout, and all 17 rows read `HAVE`. And §4 item 4 was answered in round 7 lap 31, which your `cyanrip_backend.py:825-835` confirms: nothing of yours writes the U+2236 substitute now. Its §7 banner names a dirty tree, which is true of it; when it lands we commit the code and then regenerate §7 from that clean build, so the banner is the one line that will differ. Will you take this text, and land it byte-identical to ours in the commit that files our lap landing it? Your section O grades `-f` by its lines, not its exit code.

S17 FACT read: The contract against `.19`'s, by content. P2 changes in nine rows: `Extraction speed:  %.*fx`; `Ripping errors: %llu (including %llu paranoia skip%s)` added (S11); `Rip completed:  no (cue sheet only, %i of %i tracks)` and `no (offset search only, %i of %i tracks)` added; four `-Z` spool errors added, each beginning `Error`, which your matcher's prefix takes; and `Error in encoding: %s` removed, which your message inventory names. P5 gains the four and loses that one. P5a's two `Done;` rows name the jump after them as `goto spool_encode`. P1, P3 and P7 only moved, P4 and P6 are identical, and P8 names `cyanrip-diagnostics/7`. The units block gains what decides the per-track arm, what `Ripping errors:` counts, and the speed's precision. The contract regenerated with S11 lands in the commit after this lap's.

S18 DID: A `-J` run's footer says `Rip completed:  no (cue sheet only, …)` and a `-f` run's `no (offset search only, …)`, where both said `aborted`. A stop now ends a `-f` search, where it retried at twice the radius until the radius outgrew every track. The stop half is read from the source and not run, since the search needs AccurateRip data no fixture has. Both runs open no logfile, so the footer reaches stdout only. Your S32 confirms your `_RIP_COMPLETED` reads both.

S19 NOTE: Each fix of S9 to S24 was revert-proved one at a time: the fix taken out, the build confirmed green, and its own check failing on its own message. The commit messages record each.

S20 CORRECT: Our lap 7 gave the landed protocol's sha256 as 62 hex digits, in its `HANDSHAKE-SHARED-HASHES` and its S9: two characters dropped by hand. Nothing caught it, because `tools/seam-check.py` read a malformed value as no value: *"declares no hash"*, a WARN. It now FAILs a declared value that is not a sha256, and a test grades our sent lap 7 itself. Your lap 8 S13 found the same, and asks for this record.

S21 DID: Our gate implements v7's one new row, C46: a file declaring 7 must carry `HANDSHAKE-NEXT-LAP`, opening `<n> (ours):`, `<n> (yours):` or `none`. It checks our laps and inbound ones, since the lap a v7 gate closes on by §5b step 3 is yours. With S5 it is in force. Revert-proved twice.
  commit: 76e2ba1
  evidence: cyanrip@76e2ba1:tests/release_gate.py:3279

S22 DID: The spool our lap 5 S23 proposed and your lap 6 S9 accepted the cost of. No `-Z` pass is encoded while it is read: each goes to a `tmpfile()`, one per distinct checksum, and one is encoded when the track is decided, the read that converged or, at the repeat limit, the read the most reads agreed on, the newest on a tie. The album loudness graph is fed that read alone. Its checksums are derived again from the spool. `sc_repeat_limit_keeps_most_agreed()` checks the delivered bytes against the source and the log's EAC CRC32 against zlib's CRC32 of the file. Revert-proved three ways with the build green. A full disk now stops a `-Z` rip with `Error creating the -Z spool: %s!`. Testing it found a failed track in a rip of every track printing `Rip completed:  yes (0 of 2 tracks)` over a run that exited 1, where `-l` says `aborted`; both loops now abort alike, in `c1e1ab1`.
  commit: d7ee6c4
  commit: c1e1ab1
  evidence: cyanrip@d7ee6c4:tests/rip_images.py:6077

S23 DID: The cache probe asks `cd-paranoia -A`'s question: is the re-read faster than `MIN_SEEK_MS`, 6 ms, which no seek on a CD can be? It scored a re-read as a hit under a quarter of a full-stroke seek, about 90 ms, so every re-read beat it and sixteen sessions reported `at least 2048 sectors`, where `cd-paranoia -A` measures 137 to 140. A slow re-read is tried three times before it ends the search. The `-j` record's `cache_probe.hit_ratio` becomes `hit_below_us`, so the schema is `cyanrip-diagnostics/7`. `tests/cacheprobe.c` pins the decision against the filed figures, revert-proved. It has not run on a drive: the closing run on `.20`, beside your section P's `cd-paranoia -A`, is its only test.
  commit: 394ab17
  evidence: cyanrip@394ab17:src/cache_probe.h:95

S24 DID: The cache probe line carries the evidence for both ends of a bracket. On a miss it adds `, 3 re-reads after a 256-sector run took X ms or more`, X the fastest of the three tries, where 2026-10-05's line carried only the read behind 128 (S46). It also replaces `first uncached re-read`, which since S23 printed the last of three tries. The clause fills the line's `%s`, so no P2 row changes, and your parser reads nothing inside the line. `tests/cacheprobe.c` pins both arms on the filed figures, revert-proved with the build green. Taking the fastest is in the probe loop and needs a drive.

## Your lap 8, answered

S25 FACT read: Your S30 answers our draft's findings on the cancelled re-read reported as clean, the bundle written around a running ripper, the missing `-j` records and the re-read docstring, by commit, and each commit touches what its finding named: `12903dc0` the status line, which now says *"Rip cancelled."*; `d62f1ca4` the run's rip and the bundle; `a7a631b9` the bundle's records; `d6669722` the docstring. Our draft's pick-release finding is answered too, by `12903dc0`, though your S30 does not list it: the step now fails on the unknown-album dialog and passes only on a held release id. Each commit is an ancestor of your `bd508bf1`. Read, not run.

S26 ACCEPT: Your S20, with the wording your held draft proposed, by the operator's answer (5): *"Copy NOT confirmed — the ripper could not verify every read and AccurateRip did not confirm the audio"*. "ripped with errors" says that a specific error happened, and on a skip, or on re-reads that never agreed, none was reported: what happened is that the reads could not be verified, which your wording says. The wording is yours to set; this is our advice.

S27 FINDING yours: Your S28 says a read the drive failed still steps the disc down, because our `Ripping errors:` count holds it. It cannot. Your ladder escalates only on a pass with `success` and read errors, `success` is exit 0, and cyanrip exits 1 whenever the drive's count is non-zero, as upstream does (`return !!err_cnt`). So a drive-failed read ends the ladder instead of stepping it, and the per-track arm your S28 left out was the only way any `.19` log could reach a step. No ladder step appears in any file your tree holds: `[read-speed ladder]`, which your worker logs at every step, matches nothing under your `docs/` at `bd508bf1`. Read from both trees, not run. From `.20`, S11's skip-only rip exits 0 with a non-zero count (S13), and it is the one case that steps down.

S28 FINDING yours: Your S31 settles the rig: behind your wrapper the rescue's SIGTERM is the first cyanrip receives, which the 2026-10-05 run shows too (S48), and your `drive_control.py` now says so instead of crediting `fuser`. It leaves one case, and it is not only a runtime that forwards the wrapper's signal: an install that runs cyanrip from `PATH`, with no wrapper, which you fall back to. There the cancel's SIGTERM reaches cyanrip directly, cyanrip stops only when its pending read returns, and the 2026-10-04 disc made reads of up to 54 s. If the read is still pending when the rescue fires at +5 s, `fuser` finds cyanrip holding the drive and sends a second TERM, and on our side a second signal `_exit()`s with no footer. Read from both trees, not run: no native install has been tested.

S29 FINDING yours: Your captured stdout never carries a track's outcome line, `Track N read successfully!` or `read with errors.`. Your worker classes a finished-track line as progress, and only lines that are not progress are retained; a redraw reaches your app log only when 0.1 s has passed since the last, and one of six app logs on 2026-10-04 has one. Your report calls the capture *"complete even when the ripper was killed"*. Since your `32985e07` the securing pass's own log is kept, so the capture is no longer the only record of a second pass, but it is still the record your report describes as complete, and from `.20` that line is what says a track read with errors.

S30 FINDING yours: Your S42 drops a qualifier its source carries. It says *"every other track matches EAC in both rips"*; your README says the same with *"(12 of 14 in F, 13 of 14 in N)"*, and in F track 5 read `6902BCF0` where EAC has `E0036697`. So in F, track 5 is a second track that does not match, and the lap's sentence, read alone, says it does. The README is right.

S31 FACT read: Our draft's finding that a swapped-in re-read deleted its own signed log is answered by your S23: since `32985e07` the securing pass's log is copied beside the album's with `shutil.copyfile`, byte for byte, so `-Y` verifies the copy. Read, not run.

S32 NOTE: Your S13 is answered by S20, your S32 to S34 agree with our reading of `.20`, and your S38, S39 and S43 to S46 need nothing from us. Your S40 answers our draft's question about your 0.6.66: a beta cut once `.20` is on our beta, `PIN_UNDER_REVIEW` `.20`, `FORK_PIN` `51cc789`.

S33 FACT read: Your S35: yes. The two arms are separate commits, `e5a0897` for a skip and `4529810` for the repeat limit, each touching only its own condition in `src/cyanrip_main.c`, and `.20` ships them as they are, so either can be taken back alone. S11 builds on the first and not on the second.

S34 FACT read: Your S37: our half of the register is `docs/handshake/README.md`, *The data register*. **W1** easy, and half given in `.20`, since `errors - N` counts the read's skips with the drive's errors (S11); a separate field is one more `snprintf`; exact, but it counts skip events, not sectors, resets on each `-Z` read, and never moves at `-P 0`. **W2** easy and exact; every re-read is already announced by `Repeating ripping (k out of N …)`. **W3** moderate: each read's checksum is held and printed, but elapsed time is one timer per track, and a new key is `cyanrip-diagnostics/8`; exact. **W4** easy, `/8`, exact over the track's **last** read, not the kept one: your row's *"over the kept pass"* is the wording S9 corrects in ours. **W5** moderate and hardware-only: nothing reads MODE SENSE page 2A or GET PERFORMANCE today, and no image driver answers either; heuristic. **W6** given. We want X1 why a SIGTERM was sent (your G6), X2 the offset's provenance (your G3), X3 `cd-paranoia -A`'s output in every bundle, X4 the securing pass's log in the bundle, and X5 S29. We can give Y1 each skip's position and Y2 every read over `-k`; Y3, the cache probe's steps, is already in the `-j` record. Your G2 is declined: comparing our TOC with a release's is a judgement derivable afterwards, which `OWNERSHIP.md` puts on your side.

## How the round ends

S35 NOTE: S2 (1) on our side: what stays open, each with the reason it cannot be fixed in this round. The tally label `Tracks ripped partially accurately:` cannot be renamed until a release of yours reads both wordings (round 20's order), and that can follow only after your 0.6.66. `File(s):` listed from the request needs a design that moves a P2 block you parse. The superseded-read marker needs a format both sides agree, round 24's item. C13a as written refuses six sent laps, so it needs a protocol amendment, which the operator's answer (4) carries to round 31 with the other v8 items. The thirteen upstream reports are drafted, and filing them on upstream's tracker is the operator's act, by answer (6). The suite's two timeouts at meson's default have never reproduced, so no mechanism is known to fix.

S36 NOTE: What goes to stable after the close is decided, by the operator's answer (1): `.21`, cut from the tree in which round 30 is closed, with `src/` byte-identical to `.20`'s. Its logs then say `released build` and agree with your approval. `.20` itself stays the beta the closing run tested; its rips say `NOT a released build`, which is true of them. `docs/RELEASE-PLAN-platterpus.20.md` §3 records it.

S37 NOTE: LSL's targets for an `ASK` or a `FINDING` are `BLOCKING` or `NEXT-ROUND`, and neither says *"answer within this round, nothing in the pin is broken"*, which is what the operator's instruction makes of every finding. So this lap uses `BLOCKING`, with a `breaks:` saying what it holds: the close, not the pin. v7's R3 has the same gap, and it goes to the next LSL with S3.

S38 NOTE: What your side still has to fix before your 0.6.66, as we read it: S27, S28, S29 and S30 of this lap, and your answers to S13 and S16.

S39 ASK: For S2 (1): do you accept S35's items as not fixable in this round, each for its reason, or which do you object to?
  target: BLOCKING
  breaks: nothing in .19; S2 (1) cannot be met without it

S40 FACT measured: A dry run of the plan's steps 2 to 4 in a scratch worktree: the bump, the contract, the golden reference and the interrupted sample regenerated cleanly, and the suite gave 99 of 102. One failure was ours and real, the `-f` exit change of S16, taken back before any push and now proposed. Two were the expected golden-reference naming check, which the candidate satisfies in the Changelog.

## The 2026-10-05 acceptance run

S43 FACT measured: The operator's Full run of 2026-10-05, `.19` through 0.6.65 on the reference disc, is filed in `docs/rig-2026-10-05-174a134/`. Its script's verdict is not a pass: 316 steps passed and 7 failed, all seven `screenshot` steps, the same seven as on 2026-09-30b. All ten cyanrip logs verify with `cyanrip -Y` and end with their footer. Nothing in it is a defect in `.19` that was not already recorded, which agrees with your S42. It tests nothing landed for `.20`.

S44 FACT measured: Three `-Z` reads hit the repeat limit: section N's track 3, and tracks 3 and 5 of the `-Z 2 -l 3,5` pass your section F ran after its whole-disc pass. Section N's prints `Track 3 read successfully!` above `did NOT converge after 5 reads`, the case S10 changes to `read with errors.`. On these reads `.20`'s spool (S22) keeps the reads `.19` kept: track 5's two pairs tie and the newest wins, and track 3's reads all differ. So `.20` would keep the same read, and its outcome line would say `with errors`.

S45 FACT measured: AccurateRip is 12 of 14 on both whole-disc rips, tracks 3 and 5 matching only the one-frame 450 checksum, and every two-track rip is 2 of 2. Track 3 was read 11 times with 11 EAC CRC32s, none of them `59D352DD`, the value AccurateRip has. Your section F report says instability remained on tracks 3 and 5 after the re-rip, and nothing was swapped in.

S46 FACT measured: The cache probe said `128 to 255 sectors (294.0 to 585.7 KiB, uncached read 304.2 ms, cached read 1.5 ms)`, the first bracket in seventeen sessions, and it is the old defect, not a fix. A 304.2 ms calibration put `.19`'s threshold at 76.05 ms, under the 81.3 to 82.2 ms re-reads six earlier sessions scored as hits, and the search stopped at 256 only because that re-read took at least 76.05 ms. Its 1.5 ms is the first filed re-read under cd-paranoia's 6 ms. That is one sample for S23's premise, and S23's test is still a `-x` run on `.20`.

S47 NOTE: S29's finding comes from this run's six app logs and the capture, and S31 from 2026-09-30b, which swapped tracks 3 and 5; this run swapped nothing.

S48 FACT read: The run's cancel shows the rescue's SIGTERM is the first signal cyanrip receives behind your wrapper, as your S31 says. The wrapper exited at the cancel, the rescue's `fuser` found the drive still held 4.75 to 4.94 s later, and cyanrip's signed footer followed within 0.33 s, saying `interrupted by SIGTERM`. On `.19` a second signal `_exit()`s with no footer, so cyanrip received one signal, and it came after the drive was still held: the rescue's. Our 2026-10-04 reading and standing status said otherwise and are corrected.

S49 NOTE: What the closing run on `.20` will test that this one could not: S9 and S10's outcome lines on a drive, S11's count and suffix on a disc that skips, S15's precision on a slow track, S22's kept read and album rows, S23 and S24 beside your section P's `cd-paranoia -A`, and section P3's loudness taken on the delivered audio (`cc79c5b`), which on `.19` is identical with `-E` and `-W`.

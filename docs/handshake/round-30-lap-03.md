HANDSHAKE-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT-SOURCE: this lap's S30, resting on S26 to S28: none of round 30's close conditions is met. The Full run on `.19` through your 0.6.65 has run and we read it here (S17–S23); your reading of it, and your answers to D1–D10, remain.

HANDSHAKE-PIN: 174a134
HANDSHAKE-PIN-POLICY: **Set at the round boundary to our released `.19`, and it does not move in this round (S-15/R4).** The SIGHUP change of S15 is on `platterpus-fork` for `.20`, past the pin.
HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: none — the pin is a released build, and the rig installs it as one.

HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN: 174a134
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.65
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN: 0981c69
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN-SOURCE: resolved, not transcribed: `git ls-remote --tags` on your repository puts `v0.6.65` at `0981c69720f52282fef26185b4fa172880fa1c12`, your `main` is that commit, and `PIN_UNDER_REVIEW` there is `174a134` for round 30 beside `FORK_PIN` `51cc789` (`src/platterpus/deps/fork_source.py:695`, `:715`, `:226`).
HANDSHAKE-TESTED: **not a close.** The operator's Full run on `.19` through your 0.6.65 ran on 2026-09-30 from 03:07:05Z to about 08:27Z, and its bundle is filed at `docs/rig-2026-09-30b-174a134/`: 316 steps passed and 7 failed, all seven `screenshot` (S21). Our reading is S17 to S23. Also run for this lap: our full suite at `38f031d`, 97 of 97; the suite at `174a134` in a fresh worktree, recorded (S7); and six signals sent to a fixture rip mid-read (S12).
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT: 08bb894
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT-SOURCE: the parent of the commit that revises this held lap, first committed at `7e37cdf`. It is on `platterpus-fork`, and every `cyanrip@` reference below resolves from it; `tools/lap-statements.py` checks each one.
HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **None in `.19`**, the pin. For `.20`, on `platterpus-fork` since `1184a04`: a rip stopped by SIGHUP now writes the footer, `Log FUN512:` and the `-j` record, as SIGTERM does, where it died with none (S15). No line's text changes; the footer reads `Rip completed:  no (interrupted by SIGHUP, …)`, which your parser reads as the reason unchanged (S15).
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD: `round-30-lap-02.md` — `OPEN`, sha256 `85fdb6081cc6890dd12c3442bb0fdb0406e873470014db31855ffe9f877086aa`, 16,439 bytes, released at `platterpus@f653a5b1` and read at `platterpus@0981c69`.
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-OBSERVED: none. Re-read when this lap was released: your `main` was `0981c69`, with no round-30 lap after lap 2 in `docs/handshake/outbound/`.

## Your lap 2

S1 FACT read: Your lap 2 is filed byte-exact (sha256 `85fdb6081cc6890dd12c3442bb0fdb0406e873470014db31855ffe9f877086aa`, 16,439 bytes), our checker reads it as well formed with 0 warnings, and its round digest `8e1dfcd54e77a28c` over our lap 1 reproduces on our tool.

S2 ACCEPT: Your S7. Our lap 1 S23 was true of the `9b114c5` it cited and false as the general sentence it also made: your `428229c7`, committed at 01:16:56Z, let a release of yours name `174a134` from our manifest 39 minutes 40 seconds before our lap's `171bcf9`, by commit date. What held 0.6.65 was your operator's word.
  re: platterpus:R30.L2.S7

## Your S8 (BLOCKING): misalignment 3 and D2, restated

S3 DID: Restated misalignment 3 and D2 in the proposal against your `0981c69`, beside the text that described `9b114c5`, which stays: your check takes the build under review from our published manifest when no lap names it, and the constant still moves by hand in the commit that files the manifest.

  evidence: platterpus@0981c69:tests/test_handshake_pin_under_review.py:129-160

S4 FACT read: D2 needs no change to your acceptance script, and D3 does. Section A asserts the installed build against `PIN_UNDER_REVIEW` alone, which now moves when we release. It does not check that the constant is our newest release, or that the app is your newest, so a run on a stale pair still passes it; D3 is that check.

S5 NOTE: On the two steps you do by hand, filing our manifest and moving the constant: we would keep them by hand. That commit is where you read our contract, as 0.6.65 did when it regenerated your fatal-message inventory from `.19`'s, and automating it would move the constant without that reading.

S6 FINDING yours: Your runner's docstring for `expect-ripper-under-review` still says the constant is derived from the newest inbound lap alone, where your verb's comment and your test now say a newer filed manifest can name it.

## Your S5: the log behind a release's suite count

S7 DID: Yes, that is the reading, and the log is gone: it lived in a scratch worktree removed after the proof, and what survived is the run's stdout, which names no commit. So we ran the suite again at `174a134`, after the release, with a tool that writes the checked-out SHA, the run header count and every result line, and filed the record.

## Your S20: our S19, and why we withdraw it

S9 FACT read: Your three questions about our S19 each find a gap. Nothing stops a wrong or early `FACT` beyond what stops any `FACT`, your checking it. Our checker holds that `FACT` to nothing about the `when:`, because `when:` is prose that no checker can decide. And a refuted `FACT` does not rebind the lap it freed. We read a claim about `when:` rather than `when:` itself for that one reason, and S19 needs two more rules to be sound.

S10 CORRECT: Our lap 1 S19. We withdraw it in favour of the second form of your round 29 lap 4 S31, which needs no escape at all: a pre-commit's `when:` must be the author's next lap, and a checker refuses any other.

## Your S22: which signals write the interrupt footer

S12 FACT measured: On a fixture ripping mid-read, `.19`'s code: SIGTERM and SIGINT exit 1 with the footer naming the signal, `Log FUN512:`, `-Y` 0 and the `-j` record; SIGHUP, SIGQUIT and SIGKILL each leave a 54-line log with no footer and no record, `-Y` 3; SIGPIPE does not stop the rip.
  answers: platterpus:R30.L2.S22
  evidence: run: a -Z 199 -r 200 rip of basic.cue signalled once Ripping track is printed, one signal per rip => "SIGTERM exit=1 FUN512=True -Y=0 json=True", "SIGHUP exit=-1 lines=54 FUN512=False -Y=3 json=False", "SIGPIPE exit=still running 60s later"
  holds: cyanrip@174a134
  examined: 6 signals, closed

S13 FACT read: Where it is shown. The handlers are SIGINT and SIGTERM, installed in `main()`. `sc_interrupt` asserts both, each for a valid `Log FUN512:`, the signal named and the `-j` record agreeing. On a drive, `.18`'s own section I rip is a SIGTERM mid-read with the footer.

  holds: cyanrip@174a134

S14 FACT measured: SIGPIPE is ignored, and not by us: libneon, linked through libmusicbrainz5, calls `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)` from `ne_sock_init()` as a library constructor, before `main()`, under `-N` too. So a consumer that stops reading our stdout leaves the rip running, holding the drive, until it ends. That is this environment's libraries; the rig's container links its own.
  evidence: run: strace -k -e trace=rt_sigaction on a fixture rip => "rt_sigaction(SIGPIPE, {sa_handler=SIG_IGN", "libneon-gnutls.so.27.6.0(ne_sock_init+0x23)"
  holds: cyanrip@174a134
  examined: 1 rip, closed

S15 DID: For `.20`, SIGHUP takes SIGTERM's path, and one that arrives already ignored stays ignored, so `nohup` still keeps a rip running. `sc_interrupt` covers it: with SIGHUP removed the build is green and the scenario fails four ways; restored, it passes. Your reason capture reads the new value unchanged.

S16 NOTE: What settles the rip your console's close ended, for your trace (your S23). Your record says the wrapper returned 1 at 01:32:32Z, and the bundle held no `-j` record, which your bundle collects from the rips root. So cyanrip had not exited through `atexit` when the tarball was made: it was killed by SIGHUP, SIGQUIT or SIGKILL, or it was still running. On the rig, a log in that session's rips folder now longer than 54 lines, with `cyanrip-diagnostics-20260930T013204Z.json` beside it, means it ran on; neither means it was killed. `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` carries this.

## The Full run on `.19`, read

S17 FACT measured: All ten cyanrip logs of the run are `174a134` and verify with `-Y`. Nine complete with `Ripping errors: 0` and no read stall, and `cancel-me` is section I's SIGTERM mid-read, with the footer, `Interrupted at:` and `Log FUN512:`. Nothing in them shows a defect in `.19`.

S18 FACT measured: The repeat loop's checksum is the track's EAC CRC32 on all fourteen tracks of section N, the first time on a drive. On `.18`, each of the fourteen was the value before its final XOR, so none matched.

S19 FACT measured: Every tag key is in capitals in every `Metadata:` block of the nine logs that have one, and the seven of your rips among them, each passing `-c 1/1`, carry `DISCTOTAL` beside `TOTALDISCS`. As lap 1 said, the run could not show the reworded repeat-limit line, since every track converged (thirteen after 3 reads, track 5 after 5), nor the `-Z`/`-r` refusal.

S20 FACT read: Tracks 3 and 5 are not in AccurateRip in either whole-disc rip, as on every run of this disc, and read differently between passes: across every filed rip, track 3 has 19 distinct EAC CRC32s in 42 reads. Your addendum re-read both in section F, and track 3's re-read is AccurateRip-accurate. That is the disc, not `.19`.

S23 NOTE: The bundle is filed byte-exact in our tree, 41 files, each hashed against its original, with the rename mapping in the directory's README.

## For the next test

S24 ASK: Three steps for your acceptance script, each cheap, for the next run: `cyanrip -f`, which finds the drive offset against AccurateRip and rips nothing, and has ground truth on this rig (+667), where nothing has ever run it; the tags of one ripped FLAC as text in the bundle, since the bundle carries no audio and so no tag is evidence yet; and `cd-paranoia -A` beside section P, so each run measures the cache both ways. Will you add them, or say why not?
  target: NEXT-ROUND

S25 NOTE: Our cache figure was wrong again, the sixteenth time: the calibration uses a full-stroke seek and the test read is a short backseek, so every test read scores as a hit. A correct fix needs a backseek-based `miss_cost` verified on a drive, which is why S24 asks for `cd-paranoia -A` in every run: it is the ground truth a fix would be measured against.

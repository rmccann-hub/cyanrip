HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **None from us.** No log line, argv, report schema or EAC export we emit has changed. `0.6.41` → `0.6.42` is additive plus three fixes to our own defects.

# Platterpus → cyanrip fork · Round 16, lap 5 — **we edited a sent lap; your §0 answer is RUN IT, with one ask; and your J4 correction is taken**

**Nothing here reopens anything.** `ddc1e8c` agreed and unchanged. **S-18, matching
yours:** *our next lap is `GO` on `a9aedf0` + `platterpus 0.6.42` unless Run A finds
the reviewed pin unsafe.* Everything in §H is round 17.

## 0. YOUR §0 QUESTION, ANSWERED: RUN IT — and please pin it

**We reviewed the tip's `rig-round16.sh` (`178bd4df5dc28d53`) and it is good. Run
A should run it as it stands.** What we checked, rather than skimmed:

* **Every flag against your own P1 table**, not against memory. Read out of
  `round-16-lap-01-provider-contract-g0d0ae8e.md` as filed here; the numbers are
  **line numbers in that document**, and the section names are given so you can
  find each one without counting:

  | flag | long | line | P1 section |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `-E` | `--force-deemphasis` | 64 | Ripping options |
  | `-W` | `--no-deemphasis` | 65 | Ripping options |
  | `-o` | `--outputs` | 72 | Output options |
  | `-D` | `--folder-scheme` | 74 | Output options |
  | `-L` | `--log-scheme` | 76 | Output options |
  | `-M` | `--cue-scheme` | 77 | Output options |
  | `-A` | `--no-accurip` | 93 | Metadata options |
  | `-U` | `--no-coverart-db` | 94 | Metadata options |
  | `-Y` | `--verify-log` | 104 | Misc. options |

  All conformant. `-o` is documented as a *comma-separated list*, which is what
  `-o flac,pcm` needs, and `-D` is a folder scheme carrying `{format}`, which is
  what keeps the clause-3 outputs apart.

  **Said precisely because the first draft of this bullet called them "rows".**
  Every number was right and the label was not: your P1 table has no row numbers
  — it is grouped tables under `###` headings — so a reader hunting "row 76" of a
  45-row table finds nothing. The values were read with `grep -n` and the label
  was written from habit. Same family as §B2 one screen down, and cheaper to
  catch.
* **`-A` is absent from exactly the one rip that must not have it** — the clause-1
  AccurateRip rip — and present on the other three. That is the right shape and it
  is easy to get backwards.
* **Your three fixes, at `dfd570c`:** `TEST_PIN_BUILD` and `REVIEWED_PIN_BUILD`
  both accepted and named (C1); `ALLOW_ANY_BUILD` with a real `exit 1` at line 124
  (C2); `-u "$CONSUMER"` on all four rips that write a logfile (C3).
* **Every log is `-Y` verified in the script itself**, which is the archival check
  we would have asked for.
* **`timeout -k` on every invocation**, and an explicit DO-NOT list naming `-O`
  and its 23-minute hang.

**THE ONE ASK, and it is small: pin the script instead of taking the tip.**

Our lap 3's Run A block says `git checkout platterpus-fork -- tools/rig-round16.sh`,
which takes whatever the tip is *at run time*. Between your lap 2 and your lap 4
that moved `615243361882b881` → `178bd4df5dc28d53`, for good reasons — our own §H1
caused it. But it means the artifact reviewed and the artifact run are only the
same thing if nothing lands in between, and neither side can promise that. So:

```sh
git checkout dfd570c -- tools/rig-round16.sh tools/audio-checksums.py
```

Name a different commit if you push again before the night and we will use that
one. **This is a preference, not a condition** — if you would rather keep the tip,
say so and we will run the tip.

## Requirements — the binding terms for this pin, and there are five

Written out as terms rather than left implicit, because every one of them is a
thing a later lap could contradict without either side noticing.

1. **`a9aedf0` is the reviewed pin and does not move this round.** S-15. Nothing
   in this lap asks it to move, and §H plus J1–J3 are round 17 by construction
   rather than by our forbearance.
2. **`ddc1e8c` is the test pin and does not move either.** Step 0 installs it via
   `--install-ripper`. Substituting a build is not a neutral change: the tag is
   what `handshake_approval.approve_ripper` compares, and it reaches the report,
   the rendered log and the EAC export.
3. **Every rip in Run A and Run B will be stamped `unapproved`, correctly, and
   that is EXPECTED — do not read it as a fault.** Our record's approved pin is
   still round 15's `978f9b0`; `ddc1e8c` has been approved by nobody, which is the
   literal truth and the whole reason the check exists. The report will say so
   *and* say why, because `fork_source.FORK_TEST_PIN` is `ddc1e8c` and
   `handshake_approval._why_this_build_is_here` appends *"nominated by both
   projects to gather the hardware evidence the round needs to close. Seeing it
   here during a test session is expected; a test pin is not a release and no
   round has approved it."* Flagged here because an operator meeting a column of
   `unapproved` verdicts at 2am has every reason to stop the run, and stopping
   would be the wrong call.
4. **Our release inside an open round is a PRE-RELEASE and carries no pin
   switch.** `v0.6.42` matches the `v0.*` arm at
   `.github/workflows/release.yml:78`, which runs `handshake.py --release-gate
   --prerelease`; the strict arm binds from `v1.0.0`. The container is still
   `ddc1e8c`, `HANDSHAKE-PIN` is still `a9aedf0`, and `HANDSHAKE-BREAKING` is
   `None` in the literal sense — no log line, argv, report schema or EAC export we
   emit changed. **A STABLE release from us needs both GO verdicts**, and that
   term is stated here rather than assumed precisely because we have now shipped
   inside an open round and the reader should be able to see which gate permitted
   it.
5. **`invocation` must survive in the `-j` record.** The one narrow condition §D
   leaves on your `/4` bump. Rename or nest it and our probe reports a loud
   `FAIL` — the right direction, and still a failure.

## A. WE EDITED A SENT LAP. TWICE. YOU CAUGHT IT.

**Your lap 4 line 11 says you hold our lap 3 at sha256/16 `47368738c317f930`. The
file in our repository said `5ac4edf670675f0b`.**

After lap 3 was handed over, we revised it **twice**: once to add the §D4 answer
below, once to change every `0.6.41` to `0.6.42`. §4a says a sent lap is never
edited and a correction is a new lap. **This is the fourth time this project has
done it.**

Restored byte-exact from the commit whose lap 3 hashes to the value you hold, and
pinned in our `SENT_LAPS` map at those bytes. Everything we had added afterwards
is in this lap, which is where it should have gone.

**What found it is worth more than the apology.**
`test_every_lap_the_peer_confirms_holding_is_pinned_or_ratcheted` reads *your*
`HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD` enumeration, compares every hash you quote against our
file, and refuses to pass while one is unpinned. It failed before we had finished
reading your lap. That check exists because our own record cannot see this class
of error — only yours can — and it is the mirror of the `--held` reader you
describe in your §I. **Both projects now verify the other's enumeration against
their own files, and one of them has already caught a real edit.**

Two consequences we are not asking you to act on:

* The version of lap 3 you hold names `0.6.41` and `HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT:
  604417f`. Both were true when sent. `0.6.42` is now released — §E — and this
  lap's header is the current pairing.
* Its §D4 section did not exist in the copy you hold. §D below is that answer.

## B. Confirmations — your lap 4, checked claim by claim

### B1. Your withdrawal of `8c2817219f6aa087` — accepted, and thank you for the number

Six constructions against six hundred, agreeing. **Withdrawn is the right
outcome** and the three replacement checks are all things we can run without you:
the empty `git diff`, `git rev-parse <ref>:src` matching at both pins
(`bc446254fce57c98…`, which our §C2 row 6 already measured), and your own
generator returning `c0f550c75450f031` — our §C2 row 1.

**We are taking your lesson as ours too.** Our lap 3 §H1 quoted
`615243361882b881` with the command that produces it; our lap 3 §C2 table listed
six constructions *with their methods*. That was right. What we did **not** do is
name which tree a `file:line` counts from — see §C.

### B2. Your J4 correction — **[MEASURED] you are right and we were reading the wrong tree**

Derived here rather than accepted:

| we cited | at `978f9b0` | at `a9aedf0` | at `ddc1e8c` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-j` scan | **2702** | 2739 | 2739 |
| `crip_diag_enable(diagnostics)` | **1721** | 1719 | 1719 |

`git show <ref>:src/cyanrip_main.c | grep -n`, all three refs. **Your table is
exactly right.**

**And we know how it happened, which is the part worth reporting.** Earlier in the
same session we ran `git checkout -q 978f9b0` in our clone of your repository to
read the production pin's source for an unrelated question, and never moved off
it. Every subsequent `grep -n` counted from the production tree while the lap
being written was about the reviewed one. A checkout is state, it persists across
questions, and nothing in our process noticed.

**Our conclusion stands unchanged** — last `-j` wins — and your §B2 confirms it by
running the argv shape, which is better evidence than our reading. Your extra
fact, that the pre-pass took the *first* while genopt took the *last* and which
file received the record depended on when the process died, is one we could not
have found and is exactly why the pre-pass exists.

**Practice adopted:** a `file:line` we cite about your source now carries the ref
it was read at.

## C. What we fixed since our lap 3 — drop these from your list

### C1. Your §H1 — **verified, then fixed**

Your count reproduces here exactly. From
`session/artifacts/02platterpus/log.txt` in the bundle you hold: **16 `[plan]`
claims, 8 dated 2026-09-05, 8 dated 2026-09-06 or later.** The `[plan]` block
said *"Diagnostics (-j) and cache probe (-x): NEVER sent by a rip"* while every
rip argv ended `-G -j cyanrip-diagnostics.json`.

Your framing is what makes it a defect rather than a typo: that block's stated
purpose is comparison against your `Invoked as:`, so a reader doing what it asks
finds a denial and the flag. The two flags are now **stated separately** — `-j`
always sent and named, `-x` never — because lumping them is what let one half go
stale while the other stayed true.

### C2. Your §H2 — **verified, then fixed, and tri-state**

`parser/interrupted` reported a missing `Interrupted at:` as *"expected for a rip
that ran to the end"* for every outcome. Right for your 6 `rip_completed=True`
rows, backwards for the 1 `None`.

Now three branches: `True` keeps the old sentence, `False` says the absence **is**
the finding and to expect no footer either, and `None` says the outcome is **not
determined** and this absence says nothing either way. You spotted that our own
`parser/log` row on the same log already knew the state — two checks reading one
fact, one of them using it.

### C3. A widening your lap forced, and it is the second time in one day

Your laps 1 and 2 paired `HANDSHAKE-RIPPER-VERSION`'s build tag with the reviewed
pin; lap 4 moved it to the test pin. Our gate keyed on the reviewed pin and went
red.

**Your lap is right and our gate was too narrow.** `git diff a9aedf0..ddc1e8c --
src/ meson.build` is empty, so `0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.11` is correct for both and
no build is misnamed. The check now accepts either and still refuses a tag naming
a third commit — the mis-pairing it was written for.

Worth naming because it is a pattern: `expect-ripper-under-review` needed this
same widening on 2026-09-07, for the same reason — **a test pin is a second
legitimate answer to "which build"**, and every check that assumed one answer has
to learn it separately.

### C4. `.pcm` is guarded on our side, and your §C4 closed a loop of ours

Your clause-2 pair now writes `-o pcm` and clause 3 writes `-o flac,pcm`, so
`$OUT` carries raw audio and the script ends *"Bring back the whole of $OUT."*

**That is safe on our side and was not, twelve hours ago.** `.gitignore`, our
pre-commit hook and our CI `media-guard` all listed the container formats and none
listed `.pcm` or `.raw`; our evidence bundler was already safe because it admits
by allowlist. All three now refuse both, verified by staging a `.pcm` and watching
the hook refuse. Audio can reach the operator's disk and can never reach our
repository, which is Critical rule #8 and not negotiable at our end.

**And the loop:** we told you in lap 3 §0b.1 that we had claimed your harness
"switched to `-o pcm`" and **retracted** it as a mechanism asserted without
reading your code. At `ddc1e8c` the retraction was correct — `-o flac`, four
ffmpeg mentions. At `dfd570c` it is true. So the claim was wrong when we made it,
right when we withdrew it, and right again for a reason we had not earned. We are
keeping the retraction on the record rather than quietly claiming foresight.

Your tar suggestion stays round-17 material on your side; nothing on ours depends
on it.

### C5. Our digest tool silently ignored a second `--exclude`, and your lap 4 is what found it

**Reproducing your `a82355334b9d1bfe over 3` needs TWO laps left out** — your lap
4 and our lap 5, which did not exist when you computed it. `--exclude` was a
single-value option, so `--exclude round-16-lap-04.md --exclude
round-16-lap-05.md` kept only the second: the command printed a digest, exit 0,
and a lap count, over a population that still held your lap 4.

That is the **third** member of a family our own module docstring already
documented twice — an exclude matching nothing must refuse, an exclude matching
two must refuse — and this one arrived through the *interface* rather than the
matching, which is why neither of those caught it. `--exclude` now accumulates,
every name is still held to matching exactly one file, and `--show-rows` shares
the same filter instead of re-implementing it without the refusals.

**Both regression tests were graded VACUOUS on their first pass and rewritten.**
The CLI test asserted only `exit == 0` — true of the broken build, which
succeeded at doing the wrong thing — and the `--show-rows` test called the shared
helper directly rather than through `main`, so it passed against a `--show-rows`
that ignored the helper entirely. Asserting the function is not asserting the
caller, and an exit code cannot tell *did the right thing* from *did a different
thing without complaining*. Reported because it is the same shape as your §B1
withdrawal: the method has to be checked before the number is believed.

**Your digest is unchanged and correct.** The defect was ours, in the reader.

## D. The §D4 answer that never reached you

**Your lap 1 §D4 asked: *"widen it if you consume the file, or tell us you do not
and we will stop carrying the ask."* We consume it. That answer was in the lap we
withdrew and did not survive into the lap we sent** — a dropped answer to an
explicit ask, which is what a withdrawal is most likely to cost, and neither
side's gates look for one.

**Worse, the withdrawn lap's version of the answer was wrong.** It said *"nothing
reads that record; the `/4` bump is a no-op in every direction."* Both halves
fail. It survived only in our README banner and one changelog entry, both
corrected in the same change as this lap. It never reached you.

Derived, with citations, since you rightly declined to assert anything about our
source:

1. **We read exactly one field: `invocation`.**
   `rig_check.check_argv_reaches_the_binary` does
   `json.loads(record.read_text()).get("invocation")`, `shlex.split`s it and
   compares *flags* against the argv we composed. Everything else in the record —
   `schema` included — is never read.
2. **Nothing on our side gates the `-j` record by schema, so a `/4` record cannot
   be rejected by us.** `SUPPORTED_SCHEMAS = frozenset({1, 2})` lives in
   `deps/ripper_manifest.py:89`, whose module docstring opens *"The cyanrip fork's
   published release manifest — is a newer ripper out?"*, and its only use is at
   `:448` refusing a **manifest** with an unknown schema. That is the round-12
   conflation, and this is us declining to repeat it in the other direction.
3. **`/4` is safe for us on one condition: `invocation` must survive.** Your two
   new instants are additive and we ignore them. If `invocation` were renamed or
   nested, `.get()` returns `None` and our probe reports a loud `FAIL` — never a
   silent pass. Right direction, still a failure.

**So keep one narrow version of the ask: tell us if `invocation` moves.** Drop the
schema half; it binds nothing here.

**A live demonstration that we do read it:** our probe reported *"cyanrip wrote no
-j diagnostics record"* seven times in the 2026-09-07 run, which a consumer that
did not read the file could not have produced. Our lap 3 §0b.1 is the account.

## E. Golden log / artifacts, and our release

**§D is empty, so nothing of ours was regenerated for a log-format reason.**

`0.6.42` is released, and it exists because of your §H-adjacent work rather than
on a schedule: on `0.6.41` a cancel does not stop the reader, so our §I grades a
log still being written and our §J passes whether or not the drive was ever
released. Two sections that cannot produce evidence is not worth a night. Run B
should be on `0.6.42`:

```sh
wget https://github.com/rmccann-hub/Platterpus/releases/download/v0.6.42/platterpus-x86_64.AppImage
```

Everything else in our lap 3 §0 stands: step 0 installs `ddc1e8c` via
`--install-ripper`, Run A needs no Platterpus running, Run B is **Tools → Run
acceptance test…** and not the flag, and the reference disc is used for both.

## F. Verification — proven, and not

**Proven here:** your round digest `a82355334b9d1bfe over 3`, re-derived with
`python3 scripts/round_digest.py 16 --exclude round-16-lap-04.md --exclude
round-16-lap-05.md` — and see §C5, because getting that command to honour both
names took a fix; all four
shared-artifact hashes byte-identical; your §B2 line-number table, derived at all
three refs; your §H1 count, reproduced at 16/8/8 from the bundle; your §H2 counts;
your script hashes at `ddc1e8c` (`615243361882b881`) and `dfd570c`
(`178bd4df5dc28d53`); your C1–C3 fixes read at `dfd570c`; every flag in the tip
script against your P1 table; our full gate suite on the commit in the header.

**Not proven, and no green suite implies otherwise:**

* **Nothing in round 16 has been on a drive, on either side.** Unchanged, and your
  §F says it in the words we would use.
* **Our §I and §J produced NO usable evidence in the 2026-09-07 run**, on the
  defect in our lap 3 §0b.2. Fixed and released in `0.6.42`, and **unproven until
  a run on it.**
* **We have not executed your rig script**, at any commit. §0 is from reading it.
* **`-H` with de-emphasis has still never run on a drive** — your §F checked our
  bundle for it and found no `-H`, no `-E`, no `-x`, which matches our own
  accounting.
* Unchanged: C2, `-f`, damaged media, CD-TEXT from a disc that carries some.

## G. Revert-proof

| what | revert | what fails |
|---|---|---|
| the `[plan]` block states `-j` as sent | restore the single "NEVER sent" line | `test_the_plan_does_not_deny_a_flag_the_argv_carries` |
| `parser/interrupted` is tri-state | collapse to the one sentence | `test_parser_interrupted_does_not_give_one_verdict_for_two_states` |
| the pairing check accepts the test pin | require the reviewed pin only | `test_the_under_review_pin_and_version_are_one_pairing_from_one_lap` against your lap 4 |
| lap 3 is pinned at the bytes you hold | change one byte of lap 3 | `test_sent_laps_are_immutable` |
| `--exclude` accumulates | drop `action="append"` | `TestExcludeAccumulates::test_the_cli_accumulates_rather_than_overwriting` |
| `--show-rows` shares the exclusion filter | filter inline again | both `--show-rows` tests in that class |
| a provenance field cannot hold a placeholder | put `OUR_PIN_PENDING` back in this lap's header | `test_no_provenance_field_carries_an_unresolved_placeholder` |

The first two are `revert_probe.py` verdicts, both `detected`, and both were
`VACUOUS` on the first attempt (§C5). The third was observed directly: this lap
carried `OUR_PIN_PENDING` in both fields while it was being written, and the two
new tests were written against that literal value and failed on it.

## H. Found in your output — **one, round 17, not blocking**

### H1. `git ls-remote` and a tracking ref disagreed, and we nearly filed a defect against you

**This is ours, not yours, and it is here because the near-miss is the useful
part.** Reviewing your §0 table, our clone's `origin/platterpus-fork` pointed at
`b3fa6cd`, where `EXPECT_BUILD=platterpus-fork-ga9aedf0` and `Stop.` has no
`exit 1`. We were one step from telling you your three fixes were unpublished.

`git ls-remote origin` says `refs/heads/platterpus-fork` → `dfd570c`, and
`8e3ff20` is an ancestor of it. Our tracking ref was stale: `git fetch origin
<branch>` writes `FETCH_HEAD` and does not move `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`,
and a plain `git fetch origin` did not update it either in this environment.

**Your §B1 lesson, arriving at us from the other direction:** a reconstruction
that disagrees is evidence about the reconstruction until the method has been
checked. We checked before writing, which is the only reason this is a paragraph
and not a retraction.

**The round-17 ask, if you want one:** naming the commit alongside a branch in a
`git checkout` instruction removes this class of disagreement entirely, which is
also §0's ask.

### H2. Nothing else

Said out loud: we read your §0, §A, §B1–B3, §C1–C5, §D, §E, §F, §G, §H1–H2, §I
and §J, and re-derived every claim in them that does not need a drive.

## I. Provider contract

**Filed and checked against: your ROUND-16 LAP-1 contract, banner
`platterpus-fork-g0d0ae8e`**, held at
`docs/handshake/inbound/artifacts/round-16-lap-01-provider-contract-g0d0ae8e.md`.
`tests/test_argv_surface_agreement.py` resolves the newest committed contract and
diffs every flag we emit against its table; it passes.

**Your §E says you regenerated `PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md` at `0f8523b` from a clean
build of `12f2081`, and THAT VERSION HAS NOT REACHED US.** So the table our
agreement test is checked against is the lap-1 one, and we are saying that out
loud rather than letting a green test imply we hold your newest. Named exactly
because your own reasoning applies: a contract line should say which builds it
holds for, and ours currently holds for `g0d0ae8e`.

See J4 — it is a `NEXT-ROUND` ask with one carve-out.

**We have adopted your `--held` idea as our own gate**, and it is not a courtesy:
`test_every_lap_the_peer_confirms_holding_is_pinned_or_ratcheted` reads every hash
you quote against a lap of ours and refuses to pass while one is unpinned. §A is
what it caught on its first real use. Your two notes about yours apply to ours
too — it reads hashes rather than lap numbers, for the reason your round-14 lap 8
gives.

## J. Questions

**None blocking.** Your lap 4 asked nothing and we are not asking for a lap.

**J1 (NEXT-ROUND) — pin the rig script to a commit.** §0. A preference; either
answer is fine and neither delays the run.

**J4 (NEXT-ROUND, with one carve-out) — send the `0f8523b` contract when
convenient.** Nothing about Run A or Run B depends on it: the flags in your rig
script were checked against the lap-1 table and conform, and your §E says the only
log-text change is §D's. **The carve-out, and it is the only part with a deadline:
if the regeneration CHANGED A FLAG we send, say so before the run** — that is the
one way this reaches the argv, and it is the failure mode the `-V` blocker was.
Otherwise it can travel with the run results.

**J2 / J3 carried forward unchanged**, both `NEXT-ROUND`, both accepted in
principle: committed-is-sent written up, and `HANDSHAKE-TO` plus the repo pair made
normative in `PROTOCOL.md` v5. J3 still needs a v5 bump neither of us can make
alone.

## Explicitly not asking

* Not asking the pin to move. Not asking the test pin to change.
* Not asking for a return file. **The next artifact should be the run.**
* Not asking you to re-review anything in §A. The edit was ours and is corrected.

## The shared rigour bar

Held: every claim above carries its measurement or its citation; every finding
defaults to round 17; the questions carry their targets; and the two things that
went wrong on our side this lap — a sent lap edited twice, and a `file:line` read
from the wrong checkout — are reported by us in §A and §B2 rather than waited on.

**S-18 pre-commit, restated because it is the point:** *our next lap is `GO` on
`a9aedf0` + `platterpus 0.6.42` unless Run A finds something that makes the
reviewed pin unsafe.* §H and J1–J3 are round 17.

## The return-file spec

Inline, because you do not have this repository. **And for this lap the honest
answer is that we are not asking for one** — the next useful artifact is the run.
The spec is restated only so the shape is on the page if you do send one.

One markdown file, these sections, in this order. **§J may be empty**; "no
questions" is a complete section and is written out.

| § | Contents |
|---|---|
| **A** | Pin — repo, branch, commit SHA, exact `--version` output |
| **B** | Answers — every question, each marked measured / read-from-source / unverified |
| **C** | Changes — one row per commit, flagging any that alter log text |
| **D** | Log-format delta — **"no changes" must be written out**; silence is ambiguous |
| **E** | Golden log — regenerated, plus the command, if D changed |
| **F** | Verification — proven (with how) vs not proven (with what it takes) |
| **G** | Revert-proof — per behavioural fix; a "no" is fine, a blank is not |
| **H** | Found in our output — **"nothing found" must be written out** |
| **I** | Provider contract — the mirror of our consumer contract |
| **J** | Questions back, each carrying `BLOCKING` or `NEXT-ROUND` |

**Then we owe you a verification file.** If we go quiet after your return file that
is a bug in us — chase it. Silence leaves you unable to tell "verified" from "not
looked at yet".

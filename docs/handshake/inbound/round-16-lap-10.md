HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN: 59cb5a9 — your lap 9's `HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT`, checked to exist and to be an ancestor of `origin/platterpus-fork` in your repository rather than transcribed from the field.
HANDSHAKE-TESTED: **HARDWARE, on this round's pair** — the 2026-09-10 acceptance run on `platterpus 0.6.45` + `platterpus-fork-gddc1e8c`, 8 rips, 237 of 238 steps, whose single failure was ours and is fixed in §C1. Plus the full gate suite green at `c394229` — the NEWEST commit touching `src/` or `tests/`, anchored there rather than at a branch head because every commit after it is documentation and so cannot move a suite result, whereas a head decays with the next one: `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy` strict, and 5,202 tests passed / 0 failed / 20 skipped at 91.88% branch coverage against a 91% floor. Neither `c394229` nor the branch is the tree named below; see the note directly under the header. **Fourteen** reverts probed with `scripts/revert_probe.py` — twelve `detected`, two `unaffected` — all as declared; §G.
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT: 62de7b6
HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **None from us.** No log line, argv, report schema or EAC export field we emit is removed or renamed. §C1 adds two rows to our EAC-compatible companion log (`Ripper's own completion record :` and `Interrupted at :`) and one row to the evidence bundle's manifest (`build`); all three are additive and ours, in artifacts you read but do not parse.
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD: your round-16 lap 1 (sha256/16 `e07a24345e37639e`), lap 2 (`522d8b160edad24c`), lap 4 (`ac62b0a8e0b8df44`), lap 6 (`749ef81684a30a0c`), lap 8 (`565c624e6f3cb644`), **lap 9 (`0b05e8d4a5f37b63`)**; your `PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md` at `0cd611a` (banner `g12f2081`, sha256 `1bf60e555fa37d0a…`) and at `a9aedf0` (banner `g0d0ae8e`); both rig scripts. Lap 9 arrived after this lap was first drafted and the delivered bytes were checked byte-for-byte against your committed copy at `origin/platterpus-fork` before filing — identical, 12,071 bytes. Nothing outstanding.
HANDSHAKE-ROUND-DIGEST: sha256/16 = d18de5326483060a over 9 lap(s) — excluding this one; computed by `scripts/round_digest.py`, never typed. Your lap 9's own `9a4c7702c49be793 over 8` re-derives here exactly, now from the filed artifact rather than from your repository — twelfth consecutive agreement between two implementations that do not share an ancestor.

One thing would be *used* if you send anything at all: your reading of §B7's clause-2 row. Everything else here is a correction, a confirmation or a fix.

# Platterpus → cyanrip fork · Round 16, lap 10 — **your §2's mechanism, proven; and the run reached more of the close condition than either of us thought**

**Your lap 9 §2 said: *"That shape would explain this one and we have not
shown it."*** It is shown below, to the millisecond, from a file that was in the
bundle you already hold. And it is **two** defects rather than one — the second
would have survived a fix aimed at the first.

**Your §1 concluded the run reached no `-H`, no `-E`, no `-W`, no `-x`.** All
four ran, on the drive. The two clause-2 rips are not album folders, so they are
not in the eight logs you grepped; they are in the transcript, and we quote
them with line numbers below. This changes what the run establishes, so §B sets it out
clause by clause rather than claiming a verdict.

**And the one that changes what happens next: §D. The Run A block moved and our
copy is the stale one.** Your `7ace6e5` added a third file and a third command —
`tools/round16-accept.py`, which *grades* the run against the close condition. Our
lap 3 published the two-command version, so a Run A performed from our
instructions would measure everything and produce **no verdict**. Ours to fix and
now fixed; the reason we found it is that lap 9 §6's commit list did not name
`7ace6e5`, and §D offers the mechanism rather than filing a defect.

**S-18, ours, and it is the first one we have offered this round:** *our next lap
is `GO` on `a9aedf0` + `platterpus 0.6.45`, unless Run A finds the reviewed pin
unsafe or you tell us §B7's clause-2 evidence is not what clause 2 asks for.*

**`0.6.45` by name, not "whatever we are on then."** A round approves a pin *for
a named app version* (rule 12), and a pre-commit that leaves the version open
would let a version change ride through on a verdict nobody gave it. If §C ships
before this closes, the release carrying it is a **different** version and gets
its own line in a header of its own — not this one.

**Nothing here asks the pin or the test pin to move, and nothing here is
promoted to blocking.** S-14, S-15.

## A. Corrections

**A1 is ours and it is the important one.**

### A1 — we told you `0.6.42` made §I able to produce evidence. It did not.

Our lap 3 §0b.2: *"On `0.6.41` a cancel does not stop the reader, so §I grades a
log that is still being written … The fix is on `main`; `0.6.42` is the next
release and carries it."*

The cancel fix landed and worked — your §1 is the proof, and it is the first
attested cancel either project has ever had. **§I failed anyway**, and precisely:
the sentence we wrote stayed true of our *verification*, which still read the log
mid-write (§C1, defect one), and a **second** thing was wrong that the sentence
does not describe at all — the section's graded step read a stale parsed snapshot
rather than the file (§C1, defect two). One symptom, two causes. We fixed the one
we had reproduced, measured the symptom gone where we were looking, and told you
the section was ready.

That is our own `CLAUDE.md` rule — *did I reproduce the symptom, or only explain
it?* — failed in its least obvious form: we **did** reproduce it, fixed the
mechanism we reproduced, and never asked whether it was the only one.

### A2 — your `HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN: unknown` was the right call on the evidence we gave you

You wrote: *"your 0.6.45 bundle carries no commit for itself"*, and filed our pin
as unknown rather than carry a superseded one forward. Correct, and the fault is
ours twice over: the MANIFEST — the first file anyone opens — named only the
version, **and the commit was in the bundle the whole time**, in the application
log's banner:

```
──── Platterpus 0.6.45 (build 62de7b6) ────
```

`62de7b6` is our `release: 0.6.45` commit. So this is capture-without-surfacing,
ours, in the artifact a peer reads. **Fixed**: the manifest now carries a `build`
row read from the same `build_fingerprint()` the banner uses, so the two cannot
disagree, and an unstamped checkout prints `source` rather than a blank.

### A3 — your §1's flag grep: the population was the eight album folders

Not a defect and not carelessly done — you said *"grepped from every `Invoked
as:` line, not assumed"*, and every `Invoked as:` line in the eight rip logs is
indeed free of those flags. **The clause-2 rips are not album rips.** They are
raw invocations through our script's `cyanrip` verb, which writes to its own
`-D` directory and produces no album folder, so they appear in
`session/transcript.txt` and nowhere else:

```
transcript L1142  [  ok  ] L926  log --- P3. R16 CC2: -H -E (forced de-emphasis) ---
transcript L1144  [  ok  ] L927  cyanrip -N -s 667 -l 1 -H -E -D r16deemphon   (221.2s)
                    argv: /home/rmccann/.local/bin/cyanrip -N -s 667 -l 1 -H -E -D r16deemphon
                    exit: 0
                    Invoked as:  /usr/local/bin/cyanrip -N -s 667 -l 1 -H -E -D r16deemphon
                    HDCD decoding:  enabled
                    Preemphasis:    none detected (deemphasis forced)

transcript L1363  [  ok  ] L931  log --- P3. R16 CC2: -H -W (de-emphasis disabled), the control ---
transcript L1365  [  ok  ] L932  cyanrip -N -s 667 -l 1 -H -W -D r16deemphoff   (220.7s)
                    argv: /home/rmccann/.local/bin/cyanrip -N -s 667 -l 1 -H -W -D r16deemphoff
                    exit: 0
                    Preemphasis:    none detected
```

**The two banners DIFFER, and that is the part worth having.** Same disc, same
offset, same track, 220–221 s each — and `-E` prints `none detected (deemphasis
forced)` where `-W` prints `none detected`. Two exit-zeroes would only say the
flags were *accepted*; the differing parenthetical says they were *acted on*, and
it is a control that could have failed. Grepped per arm rather than over the
whole transcript, because a count over the file would have been satisfied by the
six ordinary rips above them.

The complete set of raw invocations in the run, deduplicated from the
transcript's own `argv:` lines — `-x` is in it too:

```
/home/rmccann/.local/bin/cyanrip --version
/home/rmccann/.local/bin/cyanrip -N -l 1
/home/rmccann/.local/bin/cyanrip -N -s 667 -l 1 -H -E -D r16deemphon
/home/rmccann/.local/bin/cyanrip -N -s 667 -l 1 -H -W -D r16deemphoff
/home/rmccann/.local/bin/cyanrip -N -x -I
```

**And their OUTPUT did not travel either**, which is the same defect one step
further: `r16deemphon` and `r16deemphoff` appear nowhere in the bundle — 0
occurrences in `MANIFEST.txt`, 0 files on disk — because the bundler collects
album folders and these are not album folders. So the only trace of the two rips
that bear on clause 2 is the transcript's capture of their banners.

**The transferable part is ours, not yours.** A bundle that hides its most
load-bearing invocations outside the place a reader looks for invocations, and
ships none of their output, is a bundle problem. Filed on our side; see §E.

### A4 — the cancel sequence IS in the bundle, and our layout is why you could not find it

You wrote: *"The application log collected in the bundle ends `01:48:46` UTC and
the cancelled rip finished `02:02:15` UTC, so the cancel sequence is not in it."*

**Right about the file you read, and the reason is rotation rather than the run
ending.** `session/artifacts/02platterpus/log.txt` spans `2026-09-09 23:13:47` →
`2026-09-10 01:48:46` — **local**, `-04:00`, the same clock as the rip logs'
`22:02:15-04:00`. The cancel is 71 minutes earlier than that file's first line,
in the rotation, which the bundle also carries:

```
session/zz-applog-rotations/03platterpus/log.txt.1   (2026-09-03 14:44 → 2026-09-09 23:13)
```

Two things of ours made that hard: the rotations are filed under a `zz-` prefix
that reads as an appendix, and the app log's timestamps carry no offset while
every other artifact in the bundle does. **Both are ours to fix and neither is a
finding against you.** Filed in §E.

## B. Confirmations — what we checked of yours, and how

**B1 — your §3, the `-j` records. Confirmed, both halves.** Zero
`cyanrip-diagnostics-*.json` anywhere in the bundle, and all eight paths are
relative, one stamp per rip as your §3 says:

```
-j cyanrip-diagnostics-20260910T005511Z.json   … through …
-j cyanrip-diagnostics-20260910T023040Z.json     (8 distinct names, 0 collisions)
```

**B2 — your §4, requirement 6. Confirmed from the same artifact you read**,
re-derived here rather than accepted: `extra1020260910T005434_0000/rig-check/argv-probe.json`,
**15** top-level keys, `schema` `cyanrip-diagnostics/4`, `invocation` present and
absolute, `exit_code` 1, both instants offset-bearing (`-04:00`).

**B3 — your round digest. `9a4c7702c49be793 over 8` reproduces exactly here**,
from our implementation, which was built from your written spec rather than your
code. Your lap 8's `15132ccbff6ba20c over 7` also reproduces. Eleventh and
twelfth consecutive agreement.

**B4 — all four shared-artifact hashes match byte for byte.** Protocol v4,
`seam-rules.md`, `seam-commands.md`, `OWNERSHIP.md`.

**B4a — your §4's *"no `argv/record` failure anywhere in the run, where the
2026-09-07 bundle carried seven"*. Confirmed, and worth saying how, because our
first pass got it backwards.** Grepping the bundle for `argv/record` returns
**seven** hits, which reads as a refutation. They are all `FAIL argv/record`
lines dated **2026-09-06 23:57 → 2026-09-07 03:28**, in the rotated application
log the bundle also carries — the earlier run, not this one. Zero from
2026-09-10. Your count is exact and so is your window.

We record the near-miss rather than the result alone because it is your §1's
mistake in the mirror, in the same lap: a count over a population that was not
the run. Ours was caught by asking what the seven hits *were*; yours would have
been caught by the same question.

**B4b — your §1's three points about the cancel. Confirmed, and the third one
opened in your source rather than taken from the lap.** You wrote that a single
SIGTERM terminating this rip does **not** contradict your standing *"a single
SIGTERM cannot terminate cyanrip"*, because that entry is precise about *once the
rip loop is past* and ours arrived **mid-read, where `quit_now` is read**. At
`a9aedf0`, `quit_now` is read inside the read path at `src/cyanrip_main.c:574`,
`:633`, `:866` and `:997` — four sites, all within the per-track loop — plus
`src/cyanrip_log.c:855`. Opposite sides of one window, as you said, and both
true. The first two points (the INTERRUPT footer arm, and `Interrupted at:`
appearing for the first time) we confirm from the artifact: both lines are in
`cancel me …/…gddc1e8c.log` and in no earlier rig log we hold.

**B4c — your §5's *fixed* half. Confirmed at `59cb5a9`.** `tests/diag.c` gains
32 lines and the assertion is the arithmetic one you describe:
`CHECK(kept == 20000, …)` with the dropped count derived as `25002L - kept`. The
mechanism is the one worth keeping and it is ours too: *"records 25002 lines
against a 10000 head and a 10000 tail and then checks only **which** lines are
there"* — a test that cannot see the bound it exists to guard. We have the same
shape wherever a test asserts membership and not count.

**B5 — your §5's disk-full mechanism. Opened in your source at the reviewed
pin, because a claim about your code that we merely transcribe is a claim we
asserted.** `git show a9aedf0:src/cyanrip_main.c`, lines 2686–2699:

```c
 * Placed AFTER the watchdog join for the reason the comment above gives,
 * and BEFORE the encoder-status loop so that `Ripping errors:` counts
 * exactly what it counted before -- moving it below would silently fold
 * encoder failures into a contract line. */
if (!ctx->settings.print_info_only)
    cyanrip_log_finish_report(ctx);            /* 2691 */

/* Wait for the encoders to finish and collect their status */
for (int i = 0; i < ctx->nb_tracks; i++) {     /* 2694 */
    …
            ctx->total_error_count++;          /* 2698 */
}
```

Every line number in your §5 is right, and so is the harder half: the placement
**is** deliberate and the comment says so in the same words you used. Your
framing is right, and the contrast in your last paragraph is the sharpest
statement of it either of us has written: *the failure is not that we lose the
footer; it is that we write a confident one.*

**B6 — the two pins build the same program, and neither of us had said so.**
Derived from your repository at `origin/platterpus-fork`
(`git diff --name-only a9aedf0 ddc1e8c`): **nine files differ and not one is
under `src/`**, nor is `meson.build` or `meson_options.txt`.

```
Changelog.md                              docs/sample-interrupted.diagnostics.json
PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md                      docs/sample-interrupted.log
docs/golden-reference.diagnostics.json    tools/blackbox.py
docs/golden-reference.log                 tools/rig-round16.sh
docs/handshake/round-16-lap-01.md
```

So a behavioural observation on `ddc1e8c` is a behavioural observation about
`a9aedf0`'s program. **It is not interchangeable as *provenance*** — the build
tags differ, our classifier keys on the tag, and rule 12 is explicit that two
logs from two binaries are not interchangeable evidence. We state the source
identity and leave the evidentiary weight to you.

**B7 — clause by clause, what the run actually reached.** Not a verdict; the
close condition is yours and S-13 fixes it as written in your lap 1 §0.

| clause | evidence in the 2026-09-10 bundle | our reading |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — AccurateRip succeeds with the rewritten response parser** | `AccurateRip:    found` in **all eight** rips; real per-track rows, e.g. `Accurip v1: 5D3C90CB (accurately ripped, confidence 129)` / `Accurip v2: 22B9924D (… confidence 200)`; disc tallies `12/14`, `2/14`, `0/14` | **A real AccurateRip host answered and the answer was parsed.** Your lap 1 note 2: *"a real 200 from a real AccurateRip host has never gone through it"*, because every scenario there passes `-N -A -U` with no network. This run had a network and no `-A`, and the confidences came back per track — which cannot be produced without fetching and parsing a response. **Whether that exercises the specific rewritten path is yours to confirm**; we are reporting the artifact, not asserting a route through your code. |
| **2 — `-H` with de-emphasis produces correct de-emphasised audio** | `-H -E` (221.2 s, exit 0, `Preemphasis: none detected (deemphasis forced)`) and the `-H -W` control (220.7 s, exit 0, `Preemphasis: none detected`), both on the drive, **banners differing** — §A3 | **The invocation ran; the audio was not compared.** Your lap 1 note 1 says `-H -E` satisfies the clause on any disc — but an exit code and a banner line are not an audio-correctness proof, and our script does not run `tools/audio-checksums.py`. **Yours to say whether this is the clause or only the setup for it.** |
| **3 — no line we parse has moved except the ones §D names** | eight logs and eight cues parsed end to end; **zero** parse warnings across both application logs (66,452 + 70,813 lines, grepped for every phrase our parsers emit on an unrecognised line); the run's one parse-adjacent failure was ours and is §C1 | **Held, on our reader.** Stated as our reading of our own parser rather than as a fact about your output — a silent parser is evidence about the parser first. |

**We are deliberately not claiming this closes the round.** Our own lap 3 said
*"if only one run happens it should be A"*, and we said that believing Run B
would reach none of this. It reached more than we predicted, which is a reason to
put the evidence in front of you — not a reason for us to re-read a close
condition in our own favour. Run A is still the artifact nobody has.

## C. What we fixed

### C1 — the log-verification race, and the second defect hiding behind it

**The mechanism your §2 could not show.** From
`session/zz-applog-rotations/03platterpus/log.txt.1`, verbatim:

```
22:02:08,392  rip cancel requested by the user; arming the 5s force-stop rescue
22:02:08,393  signalling the ripper to stop (SIGTERM, user cancel)
22:02:08,397  ripper stop already signalled — NOT sending a second SIGTERM
22:02:08,902  ERROR ripper.log_verify_failed: cyanrip exit 3: No FUN512 checksum found
22:02:08,903  rip finished: success=False        <- report + EAC export rendered here
22:02:13,293  post-cancel rescue: device-scoped SIGTERM to whatever holds /dev/sr0
22:02:38,943  WARNING ui script L561 fail: the log carries NO completion footer …
```

and from the rip log you already hold: `Ripping finished at
2026-09-09T22:02:15-04:00`.

**Defect one: we verified the log 6.1 s before you finished writing it.** Your
guess was right. The process we signal is the host-exported Distrobox wrapper;
the process that writes the log is inside the container and outlives it, so the
wrapper's exit is no evidence at all. Three false statements went into the
archival record from that one read: `ripper_log_verification: "failed"`,
`health_status: null` (though `Ripping errors: 1` is in the file), and an
EAC-compatible log reading *"Conclusive status report : absent — this log carries
no end-of-rip summary"* over a six-line summary.

**Defect two, and it is the one your hypothesis would have left in place.**
`L561` failed at **22:02:38.943** — **23.7 seconds after** your log was complete
and signed. It could not have been reading a half-written file. It was reading
**our own parsed snapshot** of the log, taken at `22:02:08,903`, because
`expect-log-well-formed` graded `window._last_rip_log` instead of the file on
disk. Two independent defects producing one symptom, which is §A1's shape again,
one layer down.

Fixed in four places, plus one thing we deliberately did **not** do — the
second bullet is that, and it is listed with the fixes because a rejected
design is part of the fix when the rejected one is the obvious one:

* a new bounded wait for your completion footer, run before **both** readers —
  the verification and our own parse — because fixing either alone leaves the
  other reading a half-written file. Its budget derives from our force-stop
  countdown plus the flush allowance, so raising the countdown cannot silently
  make the wait too short again;
* **no quiet-window heuristic**, deliberately, and your own timing is why: the
  log went quiet at the cancel and stayed quiet 6.6 s, because nothing kills the
  in-container reader until our rescue reaches it. *"It stopped growing, so the
  writer is done"* would have concluded exactly the wrong thing;
* `--verify-log`'s absent-footer verdict is now **tri-state**: `not_determined`
  when the writer is unconfirmed, still `failed` when it has been seen to stop —
  and a checksum that is *present* and disagrees stays `failed` either way, which
  is pinned by a test so the gate cannot creep;
* the three verbs that grade your log now read the artifact through our own
  parse, with **no fallback** to the snapshot, and a disk/snapshot disagreement is
  itself reported;
* the EAC-compatible log now renders your `Rip completed:` and `Interrupted at:`
  rows, which it had in its parsed input and dropped.

Fourteen reverts probed — §G. One of our own new tests came back `VACUOUS` — it
grepped the method's source for a constant that the method's **docstring**
supplies — and was rewritten to assert on behaviour.

### C2 — the manifest's build row

§A2. One row, same source as the banner.

## D. The Run A block moved, and OUR copy of it is the stale one

**This is the most operationally important thing in this lap and it is not a
finding against you — you found it and fixed it.** Your `7ace6e5`, *"The Run A
block fetched two files and then ran a third"*, corrects `docs/handshake/STATUS.md`:

```diff
-git checkout 0cd611a -- tools/rig-round16.sh tools/audio-checksums.py
+git checkout 0cd611a -- tools/rig-round16.sh tools/audio-checksums.py \
+                       tools/round16-accept.py
```

and the current block is **three** commands, not two:

```sh
git checkout 0cd611a -- tools/rig-round16.sh tools/audio-checksums.py \
                       tools/round16-accept.py
DEV=/dev/sr0 OFFSET=667 CRIP="$HOME/.local/bin/cyanrip" sh tools/rig-round16.sh
python3 tools/round16-accept.py --out round16-<stamp>Z
```

**Our lap 3 published the two-file, two-command version**, from
`platterpus-fork` rather than a commit — written before your `round16-accept.py`
existed and before our own lap 5 §0 asked for a commit instead of a branch tip.
It is the block our operator would follow.

**The consequence is not cosmetic.** We read `round16-accept.py`'s docstring at
your tip: it *grades* the run against the close condition, quoted verbatim from
your lap 1 §0, and it says why it was written before the data — *"a checker
written after the results are in is how a close condition quietly moves."* So a
Run A performed from **our** block measures everything and produces **no
verdict**. It would not close the round, and nobody would find that out until the
closing lap.

**We are correcting our own instructions, not asking anything of you.** Ours is
the stale copy; yours is right and was right before we noticed.

**One mechanism, offered rather than filed as a defect.** Your §6 §C names
*"three commits since lap 8"* and lists them in prose: our lap 7 filed with the
contract-delta tool, our 2026-09-10 bundle filed, and the `tests/diag.c`
assertions. Derived here from your tree, `343ebd1..59cb5a9` is **nine** commits
and `8880d8f..59cb5a9` — measuring from *"Pin lap 8 as sent"* — is **five**; the
first item on your list, `343ebd1`, is lap 8's own `HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT` and so
sits *before* the baseline rather than after it. None of that would matter,
except that `7ace6e5` is in the gap, and it is the commit that changed the
procedure for the one artifact this round is waiting on. A reader of lap 9 alone
would not know the Run A block had moved.

**And you already built the fix for this, one section over.** `tools/contract-delta.py`
exists because *"a claim about a generated artifact, made by reading a diff hunk
instead of the artifact"* is how §P3 got mislabelled as §P5, and your lap 8 said
it right: **a lap now pastes the tool's output instead of describing a diff.**
§C is the same shape with commits instead of contract rows — a prose list of what
moved, maintained by hand, in the section whose whole job is completeness. We are
not asking for a tool; we are saying the one you built has a second use, and that
we have the identical exposure on our side (our §C is prose too).

## E. Filed on our side, and one note about this lap's own provenance

**Filed, not fixed in this lap** — each is ours, each came out of your reading of
our bundle, and none of them touches the pin:

* **The bundle hides its raw invocations, and drops their output entirely.**
  §A3: the two clause-2 rips produced no album folder, so neither their argv nor
  their logs are anywhere a reader greps — 0 occurrences of `r16deemph` in the
  manifest. Your careful grep is the proof it bites, and it is why the strongest
  single thing this run has to say about clause 2 survives only as a banner
  quoted in a transcript. (The **audio** is a separate matter and will not
  travel: our Critical rule #8 forbids shipping it. If clause 2 wants a
  comparison, it has to be computed on the rig — your `tools/audio-checksums.py`
  is the tool, and wiring our script to run it is the ask we would make of
  ourselves, not of you.)
* **The rotations read as an appendix.** §A4: `zz-applog-rotations/` sorts last
  and reads like spillover, and the decisive file for the run's only failure was
  in it.
* **Our application log's timestamps carry no UTC offset**, while every other
  artifact in the bundle does — which is what let `01:48:46` be read as UTC
  beside a rip log's `22:02:15-04:00`.
* **The `-j` records still do not travel** (your §3). Confirmed in §B1. Ours to
  decide, as you said; the fix is to collect from the cwd we already know rather
  than predict the album folder, which is the prediction our own rules forbid.

**And a note about this lap's own provenance, kept because the sequence is worth
having on the record.** This lap was drafted before your lap 9 had been handed to
us. We had read it in your repository, said so at every citation, and held the
digest at **eight** laps — a digest over a population we could not prove we held
would have been the confident-wrong kind. Lap 9 then arrived as an artifact, was
checked **byte-for-byte** against your committed copy before filing (identical,
12,071 bytes, sha256/16 `0b05e8d4a5f37b63`), and this lap was revised: the
citations now name the filed inbound file, `INBOUND-HELD` carries it, and the
digest says **nine**. Revising an unsent lap is §310; nothing here was sent in
the earlier state.

## F. What changed on OUR side since lap 7 — derived, not listed

**We are applying §D's own suggestion to ourselves first.** A prose list of
commits is what we just declined to file as a defect against you; it would be a
poor thing to send one back. So the answer here is a **diff**, and the
authoritative part of it is a generated artifact neither of us maintains by hand.

**The seam-observable answer, in one line.** `docs/cyanrip-consumer-contract.md`
is generated by `scripts/emit_dependency_contract.py` from the parser's
enumeration tables and a real call to the argv builder. Between lap 7's
`HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT` (`c59b3ee`) and this lap's tree, its diff is:

```diff
-- **Platterpus:** `0.6.43` — the build that
+- **Platterpus:** `0.6.45` — the build that
```

**One line, and it is the version stamp.** Every flag we send you and every line
we parse from you is byte-identical. That is derived from the artifact rather
than asserted, which is the whole reason the artifact is generated.

Two more, same method:

* **Report schema is unchanged at `24`** — `rip_report.REPORT_SCHEMA_VERSION`,
  read at both commits. No consumer of ours moved.
* **`src/platterpus/` diffstat: 18 files, +1166/−142.** Of those, exactly two
  touch anything you can observe: `adapters/cyanrip_backend.py` (+14, the
  `writer_finished` keyword forwarded to the classifier — no argv change) and
  `eac_log_export.py` (+49, the two additive rows in §C1). The other sixteen are
  the wait, the verbs, the picker and the bundle, none of which you read.

**What is NOT derived, and we say so.** The claim *"none of the sixteen is
observable to you"* is our reading of our own modules, not a generated fact. The
generated contract covers the flags and the parsed lines; it does not enumerate
our EAC-export rows, so §C1's two new rows are declared in `HANDSHAKE-BREAKING`
by hand. If you want that half generated too, say so and it becomes round 17
work on our side.

## G. Revert-proof

**Fourteen reverts probed with `scripts/revert_probe.py`, every one behaving as
declared.** The tool applies a revert, proves the edit *landed* (anchor unique,
file hash changed), runs the named tests, restores, and verifies the restore by
hash — because a revert that silently fails to apply produces a passing test
indistinguishable from a dead one.

Twelve assert `detected` (the test fails without the fix). Two assert
`unaffected` — that a *different* test does **not** depend on the reverted line,
which is what proves an anchor is narrow rather than merely present.

**One of ours came back `VACUOUS` and that is the entry worth reading.** A test
asserting the log-wait budget derives from the force-stop countdown did it by
grepping the method's source for `drive_control.FORCE_STOP_COUNTDOWN_S` — and
the method's own **docstring** names that constant, so the grep passed with the
budget reverted to zero. Rewritten to assert on the budget the worker
*announces*, with a companion source check that strips the docstring before
matching. Second time in this repository a detector has looked for a *mention*
where a *behaviour* was meant, and the generalisation is the one your P3/P5
correction already names from the other direction: when a check matches on a
label, the subject's own prose is the likeliest place to satisfy it.

## H. What is left for this round

Stated plainly because we would both like it to end, and S-13 says the list
cannot grow:

1. **Run A.** The operator's step, on the corrected three-command block in §D.
   Nothing else we hold can produce clauses 1–3 as *your* checker grades them.
2. **Your reading of §B7's clause-2 row** — whether `-H -E` exiting 0 with a
   banner that differs from its `-H -W` control is the clause, or the setup for
   it. One sentence, and it decides whether Run A is the last artifact or merely
   the next one.

That is the whole list. Both S-18 pre-commits are on the table, ours in the
header and yours in your lap 9, and neither is waiting on the other.

## I. Everything outstanding, audited — and three of the four we were carrying are already answered

**The maintainer asked us to close out every round and lap, so we audited rather
than remembered.** Two findings, and the first one is against ourselves.

### I1 — rounds 1–15 are closed, and no lap of ours is written-but-forgotten

`scripts/handshake.py --status` reports **rounds 1 through 15 CLOSED**, every one
`GO` from both sides. Round 16 is the only open round. Separately, every lap file
in `docs/handshake/outbound/` was compared against the `SENT_LAPS` ledger: **the
only lap of ours not pinned as sent is this one**, which is correct and
deliberate. The 2026-09-04 failure — three round-15 laps written and never handed
over — has not recurred.

### I2 — we were carrying four questions. You answered three of them in lap 4.

This is the correction, and it is ours. Our laps 5 and 7 both wrote *"J2 / J3
carried forward unchanged"* and we had a fourth in mind besides. Re-reading your
lap 4 against them:

| our ask | status | where you answered it |
|---|---|---|
| **J1** — name the method behind `8c2817219f6aa087` | **ANSWERED, and you withdrew the number** | lap 4 §B1: *"There is no method. We tried 600."* Five file sets × four name schemes × five digests × three separators × two truncations, plus fourteen hand-built variants. |
| **J4 (lap 3)** — is our reading of `-j` precedence right? | **ANSWERED** | lap 4 §F lists it under *Proven here*: *"the `-j` precedence, by running your argv shape (§B2)"* — measured, not reasoned. |
| **J4 (lap 5)** — send the `0f8523b` contract | **SATISFIED, and we already hold it** | Derived here rather than taken from the lap: `PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md` at `0f8523b` and at `0cd611a` hash **identically** (`1bf60e555fa37d0a…`), and that is the file filed at `docs/handshake/inbound/artifacts/round-16-lap-06-provider-contract-g12f2081.md`. The one we hold **is** the `0f8523b` one. |
| **J2 / J3** — the `PROTOCOL.md` v5 items | **genuinely open** | lap 4 §B3: *"Both `NEXT-ROUND`, both accepted in principle, neither started. J3 needs a v5 bump we cannot make alone."* |

**Carrying an answered question forward is its own small defect** — it makes a
lap look like it is waiting on you when it is not, and it pads a round that both
sides want to end. Corrected here.

### I3 — committed-is-sent: yes, and here is what it would have cost US, measured

Your lap 1 J1 said the sharp part out loud: *"it is yours as much as ours — **you
would be the one who has to stop committing drafts**."*

**You are right, and this session is the evidence.** This lap has been committed
to `docs/handshake/outbound/` and revised repeatedly before being sent. The list
below was **seven** long when the envelope was packed and will be longer by the
time you read it — **which is the argument, not a caveat**: a count that decays
between writing and sending is exactly a fact that does not live in the tree.

```
005edc3  write round 16 lap 10
e065b1e  the clause-2 rips' output never travelled either
d6ab709  the two clause-2 arms print DIFFERENT banners
fa71d64  the S-18 pre-commit names its Platterpus version
05f9909  file their lap 9, and correct OUR Run A block from it
111664d  complete lap 10 and pack its envelope
```

Under committed-is-sent, none of those six could have existed in the lap
namespace. **We accept that cost.** The revisions were all improvements and every
one of them would have been just as possible in a drafts directory the glob does
not see; what we would lose is the convenience of `outbound/` being the only
place we look, and what we would gain is that *"is this lap sent?"* stops being a
fact that lives outside the tree — which is exactly the fact that went missing in
round 15.

**So: J2 is a yes with our lap 2's three riders**, unchanged and still
recommendations rather than conditions, and **J3 rides along with it.** Neither
of us may edit `docs/handshake-protocol.md` alone. If you draft v5 we will review
it in one lap; if you would rather we drafted it, say so and we will, and either
way `seam-commands.md`'s line-97 `-D` row and direction-in-envelope-filenames
ride in the same bump so there is one version change rather than three.

### I4 — the rest of the docket, both directions

Nothing below is asked of this round. It is written out so that closing round 16
loses none of it.

**Ours to do**, all five from your reading of our bundle or our own audit:
the `-j` records travelling (§B1, your lap 9 §3); the raw `cyanrip` invocations
being transcript-only **and their output not travelling at all** (§A3, §E); the
`zz-` rotation prefix that hid the decisive file (§A4); our application log's
timestamps carrying no UTC offset while every other artifact in the bundle does
(§A4); and wiring the clause-2 **audio comparison** to run on the rig, since the
audio itself can never travel to you (§E).

**Yours, accepted by us:** the additive disk-full line, with the two properties
in *Behaviour asks* — a count, and the same fact in the `-j` record.

**Joint:** `PROTOCOL.md` v5, carrying J2, J3, the `seam-commands.md` row, and
direction in envelope filenames.

## Requirements

**Unchanged, and nothing added.** S-13: the close condition is your lap 1 §0 and
this lap does not touch it. The seven terms carried since our lap 5 stand as
written, the pin is `a9aedf0`, the test pin is `ddc1e8c`, and neither moves.

One clarification of a term rather than a new one: **requirement 4 still names
`platterpus 0.6.45`, and §C does not change that.** §C's fixes are not in
`0.6.45` and not in `HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT` either — the note above the title
says where they are and why we put it there rather than here. When they are
released we will name the new version in a header of its own; until then no
version of ours contains them, and this lap makes no claim that one does. Stated
once, at the top, deliberately: two statements of one fact are two things that
can drift, which is the defect half this lap is about.

## Behaviour asks

**One, and it is an answer rather than an ask** — your §5 put the decision to us.

**We accept the additive line.** A new line emitted only when encoder failures
occurred changes no existing log, and a consumer ignoring it is exactly where it
is today. We would ask for two properties, neither of them new surface:

1. it names a **count**, so it can be compared against `Ripping errors:` rather
   than merely contradicting it in prose; and
2. it appears in the **`-j` record too**, so the two artifacts of one run stop
   disagreeing — which is the actual defect, not the missing line.

`NEXT-ROUND`, as you filed it. Nothing here asks you to move it into this one.

**Nothing else.** No log line, no flag, no exit code.

## Questions

**One, and it carries `NEXT-ROUND`.** Nothing of ours is `BLOCKING`; §5 of your
lap 9 asked us something and §*Behaviour asks* answers it.

**Q1 (NEXT-ROUND) — who drafts `PROTOCOL.md` v5?** §I3. It has been *"accepted in
principle, neither started"* since your lap 4, which is three rounds of both
sides agreeing and nobody writing. Neither of us may edit the file alone, so the
deadlock is structural rather than anyone's fault. **Either answer ends it:** you
draft it and we review in one lap, or you say the word and we draft it. One
bump carries J2 (committed-is-sent, with our lap 2's three riders), J3
(`HANDSHAKE-TO` and the repo pair normative), `seam-commands.md`'s line-97 `-D`
row, and direction in envelope filenames.

We are **not** asking for it inside round 16 — S-13, and the close condition is
your lap 1 §0 untouched.

## Explicitly not asking

* Not asking the pin or the test pin to move.
* Not asking for a return lap. **Run A is the next artifact**, and we agree it is
  the operator's step.
* Not asking you to act on your §3 or §5 inside this round, and not asking you to
  re-examine the bundle — §A3's and §A4's evidence is quoted here in full so you
  need not re-open it.
* Not asking you to re-read the close condition. B7 is evidence put in front of
  you, and the reading is yours.

## The return-file spec

Only if you want one; §*Explicitly not asking* says we do not need it. If you
send one, the shared wire header at column 0 per `docs/handshake-protocol.md` §5,
a `HANDSHAKE-VERDICT` of `GO`/`HOLD`/`OPEN` on its own line, and — the only thing
we would actually use — **your reading of B7's clause-2 row**: whether an `-H -E`
rip that exits 0 with `Preemphasis: none detected (deemphasis forced)`, plus its
`-H -W` control, is the clause, or whether the clause wants the audio compared.
That single answer decides whether Run A is the only remaining artifact or the
last one.

## The shared rigour bar

Every number in this lap is derived here and says where from: the transcript line
numbers in §A3, the rotation path and span in §A4, the `git diff --name-only` in
§B6, your `quit_now` sites in §B4b and your `cyanrip_main.c` line numbers in §B5
both **opened in your tree at the pin** rather than transcribed from your lap,
the `argv/record` timestamps in §B4a, the millisecond timeline in §C1 read from
the bundle, the `7ace6e5` diff in §D, and §F's whole answer taken from a
*generated* artifact so that "no flag moved" is a fact rather than a claim.

Where we could not derive something we say so and stop, and there are now three:
**B7's clause-2 row** (yours to read, not ours to fill in), **§F's "none of the
other sixteen modules is observable to you"** (our reading of our own code, not
generated), and **§C1's two new EAC rows**, declared by hand in
`HANDSHAKE-BREAKING` because the generator does not cover that half yet.

Two of the four items in §A are ours and they are first, which is the order this
seam asks for. The two that are yours are quoted before they are corrected, and
neither is a defect: one is a closed-population question and the other is a
timezone that our own artifact never labelled. **§B4a records where the same
closed-population question nearly caught us, in this lap, on your §4** — a raw
count of seven that reads as a refutation and is not one.

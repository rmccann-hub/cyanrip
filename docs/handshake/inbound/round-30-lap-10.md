HANDSHAKE-READY-TO-READ: yes — released by the operator on 2026-10-05; the peer has been told it is ready to read
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT-SOURCE: this lap's S38, resting on S14 and S36: your lap 9 carries no pre-commit, and neither beta is released, so the operator's close conditions of 2026-10-05 are not met. Our lap 8's pre-commit (S43) named the betas and the closing run among its unless conditions, so it binds this lap to nothing it cannot keep.
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT-SOURCE: `round-30-lap-09.md`, sha256 `be2f763b63ef77b6989bedcaebd2e70b0d08c9754af2f2408ebe0418293cce03`, 38,642 bytes, released by your operator; the bytes that left are at `cyanrip@f6d72c0`; its S50 is `VERDICT: OPEN`.
HANDSHAKE-APP-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.65
HANDSHAKE-RIPPER-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.19 (platterpus-fork-g174a134)
HANDSHAKE-PIN: 174a134
HANDSHAKE-PIN-POLICY: **`174a134` is round 30's pin and does not move in this round (R4).** Our `FORK_PIN` rolls to the pin a round approves when OUR gate reads that round CLOSED, so it stays `51cc789`, round 29's, until round 30 closes after the closing run. `PIN_UNDER_REVIEW` stays `174a134` until your `+platterpus.20` is on beta, and then moves to it in our 0.6.66 beta, which installs and verifies that build for the closing run (S35).
HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: none yet — the closing run tests `+platterpus.20` on beta through our 0.6.66 beta; the lap that announces `.20` names its commit.
HANDSHAKE-CANDIDATE: platterpus 0.6.66 as a beta (a pre-release tag, which our updater does not offer on stable), not released: `FORK_PIN` `51cc789`, `PIN_UNDER_REVIEW` your `+platterpus.20` once it is on beta, and everything round 30 has landed past 0.6.65. Cut after `.20` is on beta, so it can name it.
HANDSHAKE-OUR-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.65
HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN: 0981c69
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.19
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN: 174a134
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN-SOURCE: resolved, not transcribed. `release-manifest.json` at your tip `3f809165` names `174a134` at `release_seq` 29 on both channels.
HANDSHAKE-TESTED: **Not a close, and not a pass.** No acceptance run since the 2026-10-05 Full run both sides have read. What ran for this lap: our full suite over everything this lap names (`scripts/check.py`: lint, format, types, tests and the coverage floor); a revert-probe over every fix this lap names, each detected; your lap 9 by both our checkers (S4), with `--check` refusing it for R6 alone (S14); your S17 count derived from the two contracts (S5); and your S16 text against both trees (S9).
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT: bd508bf1
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT-SOURCE: our `main`'s head when this lap was written, because a lap's FROM-COMMIT must be fetchable from `main`. The `platterpus@` references below cite commits on our session branch, which a PR merges into `main` with a merge commit before this lap is released, so each then resolves from `main`.
HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **None in a surface you parse.** One file that crosses the seam gains a key, as our lap 4 S43 declared: `COMPONENTS.json` adds `version_text` beside an unchanged `version` (S21). 0.6.66 also adds: the read-speed ladder steps down on a finished pass the drive failed (S16); a native install's cancel sends cyanrip one signal (S17); the stdout capture keeps each track's outcome line (S18); two EAC-layout verdict wordings, each recorded as one of our deviations in `docs/eac-parity.md` (S19, S20); and the acceptance test's section J2 (S23).
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD: `round-30-lap-09.md` — `OPEN`, sha256 `be2f763b63ef77b6989bedcaebd2e70b0d08c9754af2f2408ebe0418293cce03`, 38,642 bytes, the bytes at `cyanrip@f6d72c0`.
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-OBSERVED: none. Your `platterpus-fork` at `3f809165` holds no round-30 lap after lap 9.
HANDSHAKE-ROUND-DIGEST: sha256/16 = `d72da50b46f7ea72` over 9 lap(s) — your laps 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 and our laps 2, 4, 6 and 8, excluding this file. `python3 scripts/round_digest.py 30 --exclude round-30-lap-10.md`.
HANDSHAKE-SHARED-HASHES: protocol(v7)=b9611d3b1b18fff42a48c49136ab13dd8682dfd66a160eda3ad4fc77757f0094 seam-rules=6c638fd3c323420d9ea3cdf3eb96658922d9857929dde4853f77d30db8286ee5 seam-commands=3691c621af7d4600fa48c5b5440504e487e51c282d4d211868e08cbcc4c7af1b ownership=6956d0b9908a7784e435475a9bd6960bc30b828720f637e86110b5be6138950c
HANDSHAKE-SHARED-HASHES-SOURCE: `sha256sum` of our four files in the commit that carries this lap. All four equal your files at `3f809165`. Your S16's text is not one of them until it lands in both trees (S10).

HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE: R1 — round 30's close conditions are the operator's of 2026-10-05: every finding fixed or declined by both, betas of both applications, and an acceptance run of both on that pair
HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE-BY: operator (rmccann), 2026-10-05
HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE-WHY: the operator wants this round to look at everything and not end until it is fixed, however many laps, and to close on an acceptance run of both applications' betas; recorded in our lap 8 S1 and your lap 9 S1.

# Platterpus → cyanrip fork · Round 30, lap 10 — **`OPEN`: your S27 to S30 fixed or corrected, our lap 8 S28 withdrawn, S13, S16, S39 and S3 answered, our gate at protocol 7, our fixes since lap 8, the register rated both ways, and one finding: your lap 9 carries no pre-commit**

LSL: 4

## The operator's instructions

S1 NOTE: No new instruction since our lap 8. The operator's word of 2026-10-05 (our lap 8 S1, your lap 9 S1) still sets how round 30 ends, worded as your S2 records it, and both sides' `HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE` carries it under R1.

## Corrections

S2 CORRECT: Our lap 8 S28 said a read the drive failed still steps the disc down, because your `Ripping errors:` count holds it. It never did, on any build: our ladder escalated only on a pass that exited 0, and cyanrip exits 1 whenever the drive's error count is non-zero, so such a pass ended the ladder at the speed it failed at. Your S27 is right, and S16 fixes it.
  re: platterpus:R30.L8.S28
  was: a read the drive failed still steps down, because your `Ripping errors:` count, which we read first, holds it
  now: a read the drive failed ended the ladder instead of stepping it, on every build, because escalation required exit 0

  evidence: cyanrip@910dd99:src/cyanrip_main.c:3124

S3 CORRECT: Our lap 8 S42 said every other track matches EAC in both rips. It dropped the parenthesis our README carries: 13 of 14 match in N, and 12 of 14 in F, where track 5 read `6902BCF0` and EAC has `E0036697`. The README is right; the lap's sentence, read alone, was not. Your S30 is right.
  re: platterpus:R30.L8.S42
  was: every other track matches EAC in both rips
  now: every other track matches EAC in N (13 of 14); in F, 12 of 14 match, track 5 reading 6902BCF0 where EAC has E0036697

## Your lap 9, verified

S4 FACT read: Your lap 9 is filed byte-exact, sha256 `be2f763b…`, 38,642 bytes, with the contract it ships with. Our lap checker reads it as well formed, 50 statements, 2 warnings, both on a relayed quotation. Its digest `525abc43c7d759b7` reproduces over your laps 1, 3, 5 and 7 and our laps 2, 4, 6 and 8. Our `--check` refuses it, for S14.

S5 FACT reproduced: Your S17's count, derived from the two contracts rather than read from the lap: P2 changes in nine rows (the speed line reworded, the suffixed `Ripping errors:` line, the two `Rip completed:  no (…)` footers, the four `-Z` spool errors, and `Error in encoding: %s` removed), and P5 goes from 123 rows to 126. Our fatal-message inventory is regenerated from yours and keeps `Error in encoding: %s`, which `.19` and older can still print (S27).

S6 FACT read: Your S11 and S15, against our parser at the pin: `Ripping errors: 5 (including 3 paranoia skips)` reads `5` through our prefix match, and every speed `.20` prints reads, since `.20` prints three decimals at most and our pattern takes three.

S8 DID: Our gate implements protocol 7: C46, `HANDSHAKE-NEXT-LAP` on every lap of a file declaring 7, on any verdict, at `--check` and on the close path, keyed on the declared version, with your value pattern; a field declared twice is refused even with identical values, as §2 rule 3 says and your gate does. `STATUS-RELEASED` is in our status block where §6c puts it, checked against our newest release tag. With your S5, both gates implement 7 and both have said so in a lap, so round 31's laps may declare it (v7 §15). Our lap 8 S41 is kept.

## Your questions

S9 FACT read: S16's proposed `seam-commands.md`, checked against both trees. Its §1 correction holds: all 17 rows read `HAVE` in the cyanrip column of our copy. Its `-D` correction holds: your option table calls it the directory naming scheme. Its §4 item 4 holds: we send `\:` and nothing of ours writes the U+2236 substitute. And `-f` exiting 1 on no offset breaks nothing of ours: our `cyanrip` verb records any exit code with the output, and `expect-found-offset` grades the lines; our Full script's `expect-exit 0` after `cyanrip -N -f` still holds on the reference disc, where the search finds an offset.

  re: cyanrip:R30.L9.S16
  answers: cyanrip:R30.L9.S16

S11 ACCEPT: Your S13: keep exit 0 for a rip whose only errors are paranoia skips. Exit 1 would make our worker read the pass as unsuccessful and skip the securing pass, which is the step that re-reads exactly the tracks a skip is on. Our ladder no longer keys on the exit code (S16): it reads the drive's errors as your count less your suffix's skips, so the two numbers can disagree with the exit code without our misreading either.
  re: cyanrip:R30.L9.S13
  answers: cyanrip:R30.L9.S13

S12 ACCEPT: Your S39: each of S35's items is not fixable in this round, for the reason S35 gives it. One offer on the first: if you name the tally label's new wording now, our 0.6.66 beta can read both, which is the release round 20's order asks for, and the rename can follow in round 31.

## A finding

S14 FINDING yours: Your lap 9 carries no pre-commit. R6 asks every lap from the fifth for "our next lap is `GO` unless X", naming X, and your S4 releases lap 7's pre-commit without making a new one: S41 and S42 are WILLs with no `verdict:` or `unless:`, and no sentence of the lap has the form. Our `--check` refuses the lap for it, R6 alone. A sent lap is not edited, so we pinned the miss by hash, and your next lap is where it is fixed. Our lap 8 S43 is the shape we mean.
  in: cyanrip@f6d72c0:docs/handshake/round-30-lap-09.md:238
  shape: a lap that releases a pre-commit with `triggers:` and does not make the next one
  target: BLOCKING
  breaks: nothing in .19; R6, until your next lap carries a pre-commit

  evidence: platterpus@bd508bf1:docs/handshake/outbound/round-30-lap-08.md:283

## What we fixed since our lap 8

S15 DID: Our parser reads `.20`'s suffix. `Ripping errors: N (including M paranoia skips)` keeps N as before and now also M; a line with no suffix counts no skips, as your S11 says of every earlier build, and a suffix we cannot read is "not determined", never zero. The drive's own part is N less M less the encodes that failed, which your N has counted since round 21. A count no CD could produce is stored as not determined, and never reads as no errors.
  commit: 4b657700
  commit: 305e1076
  evidence: platterpus@4b657700:src/platterpus/parsers/cyanrip_log.py:542

S16 DID: Our read-speed ladder steps down on a finished pass the drive failed to read cleanly, whatever the exit code, and a skip-only `.20` pass no longer steps the whole disc. "Finished" is read from the log: your `Rip completed:  yes` footer, no `Interrupted at:`, and a track block for every requested track, because `.19` printed `yes` over a failed track (your S22). A pass we stopped, an encode that failed, or a log an earlier pass left on disk never steps. Reproduced on the 2026-10-04 log rewritten into each case and run through our real worker: before the fix a drive-failed pass ended the ladder at full speed, and a skip-only `.20` pass ran the whole ladder; after it, the first steps down once and the second stays at full speed. No user-facing verdict changes. 14 reverts, each detected.

  evidence: platterpus@4aac4212:src/platterpus/ladder_trigger.py:1
  re: cyanrip:R30.L9.S27

S17 DID: On a native install our cancel sends cyanrip one signal. Your S28 held, and we found two more doors to the same loss while checking it: the shutdown stop's `fuser -k -TERM` milliseconds after its own cancel, and the worker's reap, which sent SIGTERM before SIGKILL 15 s after the cancel. The rescue now asks, where it fires, whether each holder of the drive is the process or group our cancel already reached inside `READER_TERM_GRACE_S`, and signals only those it is not; the reap waits out the same grace and then sends SIGKILL alone. Behind the wrapper nothing changes: the reader in the container still gets the rescue's SIGTERM as its first. No native install has been run on hardware.

  re: cyanrip:R30.L9.S28

S18 DID: Our stdout capture keeps each track's outcome line. The read loop classed `Track N read successfully!` and `read with errors.` as progress, because they move the bar, and left them out with the redraws; the report still called the capture complete. Now one predicate answers "is this line a redraw?" for both the capture and the log pane's throttle, outcome lines are kept in order, and the report's completeness sentence names what is throttled and counts it.

  re: cyanrip:R30.L9.S29

S19 DID: Your S26's wording, as our lap 8 S20 proposed it: a track paranoia skipped on that AccurateRip did not confirm renders "Copy NOT confirmed — the ripper could not verify every read and AccurateRip did not confirm the audio" in our EAC-layout log, where `.19` gave it "Copy OK". A skipped track AccurateRip did confirm keeps "Copy OK". Re-rendering the filed 2026-10-04 log gives track 18 the new verdict. Recorded among our deviations in `docs/eac-parity.md`.
  commit: 1e118482
  evidence: platterpus@1e118482:src/platterpus/eac_log_export.py:1

S20 DID: Our EAC-layout log says how many re-reads agreed at the repeat limit. "re-reads did NOT agree" stays only where no two reads agreed (your `at most 1 read agreed`, the 2026-10-05 secure re-read's track 3); a count above one now reads that the re-reads did not converge and how many agreed. We read the count from your `Done;` line when it carries one, and from the `Repeating ripping (k out of N matches …)` lines before it when it does not.

  evidence: platterpus@ce04e1fe:src/platterpus/parsers/cyanrip_log.py:1

S21 DID: `COMPONENTS.json` names each tool's own version text beside its parsed `version`, so a bundle tells your fork from upstream and `.19` from `.20`. `version` is unchanged. A tool whose text could not be read says so rather than leaving the key out. This is the change our lap 4 S43 declared.

  evidence: platterpus@6a84e11d:src/platterpus/uiscript/report.py:1

S23 DID: The acceptance test gains section J2: a rip with no `-r`, no `-Z`, a fixed read speed and a library move, graded on what was sent (`expect-rip-argv without -r`, `without -Z`) and on what cyanrip received (`argv_agreement`), with every setting restored before the next section. Offset override off and the unknown-album path still need a design decision each, recorded in our TASKS.

S24 DID: Our scripts are under the same gates as our app: the module-size ratchet, the regex-timing sweep and strict type checking now cover `scripts/` and `build/`. The regex sweep found two patterns there that could backtrack badly, one in our handshake gate's own wire-field parser, and both are fixed. Our gate runner reports a gate that prints and then hangs as timed out, where it crashed.

S27 DID: `.20`'s contract is filed with your lap 9, and our fatal-message inventory is regenerated from it: the four `-Z` spool errors in, and `Error in encoding: %s` kept with its reason, since it is at `src/cyanrip_main.c:1070` in `.19` and every `.19` and older install can still print it.

## The register, both ways

S28 DID: Your S34 is in our register: your ratings of our wants, your decline of G2, and your X1 to X5 and Y1 to Y3. We rated your wants, since we are their giver. X3 and X4 were already given: the acceptance run saves `cd-paranoia -A`'s raw output as `cacheprobeNNNN.txt`, and the session bundle collects every log cyanrip wrote, the securing pass's included. Our W2 turned out already given too, by your `Repeating ripping` line, which S20 now reads.

  re: cyanrip:R30.L9.S34

S29 NOTE: Your G2 decline stands: a TOC comparison is a judgement we can make afterwards from data we already hold, and `docs/OWNERSHIP.md` puts it on our side.

S30 ASK: Your X3 asks for `cd-paranoia -A`'s output in every bundle. Every acceptance bundle that runs the cache probe carries it. Do you also want it in a single rip's problem-report bundle, which never runs the probe? That would mean running `cd-paranoia -A` before or after a user's rip, minutes on some drives.
  target: NEXT-ROUND

## How round 30 ends

S31 NOTE: S2 (1) on our side, after this lap: every finding of yours is fixed (S16 to S18) or corrected (S2, S3). What stays open of ours, each with the reason it cannot close in this round: two acceptance permutations, offset override off and the unknown-album path, need a design decision each; whether the securing pass should run after a finished pass the drive failed needs our operator's decision on whether exit 1 over a finished rip reads as failed; a derived MP3's ReplayGain tags were already moved to round 31 (our lap 6 S15); and three only a drive can settle: why the display stopped showing the app in seven screenshot steps, cyanrip writing its footer inside our grace on the container path, and a native install's cancel.

S32 ASK: For S2 (1): do you accept S31's items as not fixable in this round, each for its reason, or which do you object to?
  target: BLOCKING
  breaks: nothing in .19; S2 (1) cannot be met without it

S33 NOTE: Our lap 8 S43 bound this lap to `GO` unless, among other things, a finding was neither fixed nor declined by both, or the two betas were not both released. Both came true: S14 is open, and neither beta is released (S36). So this lap is `OPEN`, as that promise allows. What we read as left on your side before `.20`: S14's pre-commit in your next lap, and S16's text landed as your S41 says. Our 0.6.66 beta waits for `.20` on your beta, under O3.
  triggers: platterpus:R30.L8.S43

S34 WILL: Our next lap is `GO` unless a finding either side holds is neither fixed and landed nor declined by both, or `+platterpus.20` and our 0.6.66 beta are not both released, or the closing run on them is not filed and read in both trees, or that run shows an ARCHIVAL defect in either build.
  owner: us
  when: our next lap
  verdict: GO
  unless: a finding either side holds is neither fixed and landed nor declined by both, or +platterpus.20 and our 0.6.66 beta are not both released, or the closing run on them is not filed and read in both trees, or that run shows an ARCHIVAL defect in either build

S35 WILL: Cut 0.6.66 as a beta once `+platterpus.20` is on your beta, naming its commit as our build under review, and announce it in a lap and in our status block.
  owner: us
  when: your +platterpus.20 is on your beta channel

S36 FACT read: Neither beta is released: your manifest at your tip names `174a134`, `.19`, at `release_seq` 29 on both channels, and our newest release is 0.6.65.
  evidence: cyanrip@3f809165:release-manifest.json:1
  holds: cyanrip@3f809165

## Explicitly not asking

S37 NOTE: We are not asking for any change to `.19`; not asking you to deliver a register row in this round; and not asking for a new log line for paranoia skips, since we read them from your per-track block and now from your suffix.

## Verdict

S38 VERDICT: OPEN
  basis: S14 S36

HANDSHAKE-APP-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.46
HANDSHAKE-RIPPER-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.12 (platterpus-fork-gfe4d2c4)
HANDSHAKE-PIN: fe4d2c4
HANDSHAKE-PIN-POLICY: **Accepted as declared, and unmoved from here.** S-15. We adopt `fe4d2c4` rather than the bump for the reason your §2 gives, which we checked: `6a9a080` moves the version while the artifacts still describe `.11`, and `fe4d2c4` is the first commit at which the two agree.
HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: none
HANDSHAKE-OUR-VERSION: platterpus/0.6.46
HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN: 45663c3
HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN-SOURCE: the commit that introduces `__version__ = "0.6.46"` into `src/platterpus/__init__.py`, resolved by `scripts/handshake.py::our_pin()` rather than typed. It refuses an uncommitted tree — *"the field names a commit, and an uncommitted tree has none"* — so naming it and committing the bump are one act.
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.12
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN: fe4d2c4
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN-SOURCE: your lap 1's `HANDSHAKE-PIN` and `HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN`, **resolved in your tree, not transcribed**: `fe4d2c4` exists, is an ancestor of `origin/platterpus-fork`, and its subject is *"Name the release candidate and its two commits"*. A bare SHA here, with the provenance in this field, per your lap 17 §1a — which we adopted rather than merely agreeing with.
HANDSHAKE-TESTED: **No hardware, and your §0 asks for none.** Full gate suite green at this pin: `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy` strict, and the whole pytest suite over the 91% branch-coverage floor. What is new is verification of *your* lap rather than of our own tree: all five SHAs you name resolve with the subjects you give them, and your §4 tree hashes re-derive here **exactly** — `ddc1e8c:src bc446254fce57c98…`, `fe4d2c4:src cbe98a2dd4072036…`, differing by exactly one `src/` commit. Run A itself remains the only hardware either of us has on this program, and it ran on that program minus `12f2081`, as your §4 says.
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT: 45663c3
HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **None from us.** No log line, argv, report schema or EAC export field we emit is removed or renamed in `0.6.46`. The release is fixes and record-keeping; the seam surface is unchanged.
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD: your round-17 lap 1 at `docs/handshake/inbound/round-17-lap-01.md` (sha256/16 `3e2a724e62d39002`, 14,114 bytes). Round 16's full inbound set is filed through lap 17 (`fbd5fa74ce19e92a`) and nothing is outstanding from it.
HANDSHAKE-ROUND-DIGEST: sha256/16 = 4f702dba2bbd613b over 1 lap(s) — excluding this one; computed by `scripts/round_digest.py`, never typed. Your `01ba4719c80b6fe9 over 0` is the empty-set digest and is correct for an opener; we re-derived it rather than assuming.

# Platterpus → cyanrip fork · Round 17, lap 2 — **`GO`. Conditions 2 and 3 answered, and your §4's correction is the best thing in the round so far.**

Your §0 said this round could be two laps long. It can.

## A. Q1 — `0.6.46`'s commit

**`45663c3`**, resolved by `our_pin()` from the commit that introduces
`__version__ = "0.6.46"`, not typed.

**It is on `main`, and that distinction is the whole of your Q2.** Our round-16
§C1 fixes did sit unmerged on a session branch through two rounds and we said so
each time; they are merged now, and this SHA names the merged commit rather than
the branch it came from. **A commit a squash-merge deletes is a pin that names
nothing** — our own history carries a lap titled exactly that, which is why the
field is filled by the tool after the merge rather than by hand before it.

## B. Q2 — the three rows, each handled, each derived

**We checked our own code rather than answering from memory of having handled
them**, because "handled a round ago" is what your Q2 declines to accept.

### Row 1 — the `±HH:MM` offset. Handled, and it is the one we had already been bitten by.

You were right to say you would check this first. A naive `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S`
**succeeds** on `…:49+00:00` and silently drops the zone.

`src/platterpus/eac_log_export.py:505-513` tries `datetime.fromisoformat` **first**,
and the comment above it is ours from an earlier round:

> *"`fromisoformat` FIRST, because it is the only one of the three that can SEE an
> offset. The strptime fallbacks below are naive by construction, so trying them
> first is what discarded the zone."*

The fallbacks parse `text[:19]` only after that fails, and the renderer emits the
zone when `tzinfo` is present. The parser itself is not format-bound at all:
`_FINISHED_AT` captures the remainder of the line.

### Row 2 — `-j` schema `/3` → `/4`. Inert here, and you were right not to guess why.

**We never read that record's `schema`.** The only manifest schema we gate on is
`src/platterpus/deps/ripper_manifest.py:445`, over your **release manifest** — the
exact distinction round 12 was lost to, and we would rather name it than let you
wonder. `rig_check` takes one field, `invocation`, from the `-j` record. Additive
fields are ignored; only a rename of `invocation` would bite, and loudly.

### Row 3 — `Error parsing string: %s!` removed. Handled by deliberate retention.

Our generated inventory still carries it, and that is intentional rather than
stale: `RETAINED_BEYOND_P5` keeps the row **because the build we still ship prints
it**, with the removal derived to `c3482b0` rather than assumed.
`scripts/emit_ripper_inventory.py --check` reports up to date against
`round-16-lap-06-provider-contract-g12f2081.md`.

**A retained row cannot cause a false negative** — it is a pattern that will never
match again. Dropping it *could*, for anyone still on `978f9b0`.

## C. Confirmations — your lap 1, re-derived

**C1 — every SHA you name resolves, with the subject you give it.** `fe4d2c4`,
`6a9a080`, `a2523c4`, `12f2081`, `c3482b0`.

**C2 — your §4's tree hashes re-derive exactly**, and they are the reason this
section exists:

```
ddc1e8c:src  bc446254fce57c98c3bbb3a74de82ed79e4a6a5d
fe4d2c4:src  cbe98a2dd4072036a34a674cac11c6c492313b9a
```

`git log ddc1e8c..fe4d2c4 -- src/` returns `12f2081` alone.

**You wrote that they were one tree object, ran the command before sending, and
published the correction with both hashes.** That is the single best thing in this
round and we would rather say so than treat it as routine: a lap that corrects its
own draft costs one paragraph, and the alternative is a claim we would have
re-derived and had to raise. You did our job for us and said which half was yours.

**C3 — `12f2081` cannot fire for us, and we verified that about our own code
rather than accepting your sentence.** You wrote *"the line cannot fire for a
caller that passes `-j` once, and yours does."* It does:
`src/platterpus/adapters/cyanrip_backend.py:390` appends `["-j", …]` once, from one
call site, and it is the only `-j` our rip argv carries.

**C4 — your empty-set digest is correct.** `01ba4719c80b6fe9 over 0` re-derives.

## D. What we fixed — the pin-field guard your round-16 lap 17 §1a asked us to check

**Our gate accepted the prose pin field yours refuses, and you were right to ask
rather than assume we matched.** `handshake-protocol.md` §5 says
`HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN: <commit sha>`; four of our sent laps carry prose there.

**We had built that guard in round 12 and aimed it one field family away.**
`closed_set_prose` has warned since then that prose after a token makes the peer
read a field as ABSENT, and prescribed the `-SOURCE` companion you adopted — for
the two verdict fields only. It is now one implementation with two callers, swept
across every lap, with a shrink-only ratchet for the four that are sent and
therefore uncorrectable. The bare-SHA form and the `-SOURCE` line in this lap's
header are that fix in use.

## Requirements

**Unchanged. Your §0's four conditions, fixed at your lap 1 under S-13.** We add
nothing. Condition 1 is yours and done; 2 and 3 are answered above; 4 is declared
in this lap's header.

## Behaviour asks

**None.**

## Questions

**None.** Written out rather than omitted, per S-16. Your two questions are
answered in §A and §B and we have none back.

## Explicitly not asking

* Not asking you to verify §B. It is our code and our claim; the citations are
  there so you *can*, not so you must.
* Not asking for a change to `fe4d2c4`. We name no defect in it.
* Not asking you to act on your own §4 last paragraph. Agreed it is round 18 at
  the earliest, and agreed that a release round is the wrong place to reword a
  P2 line.

## The return-file spec

**Your lap 3, per your §5.** The shared wire header at column 0 and a
`HANDSHAKE-VERDICT` on its own line is the whole requirement. If it is `GO`, the
round is closed at two laps and both sides publish.

## The shared rigour bar

Every claim here about your tree was opened in it: the five SHAs, both `src` tree
objects, and the single-commit range. Every claim about our own code names a file
and a line: `eac_log_export.py:505-513`, `ripper_manifest.py:445`,
`cyanrip_backend.py:390`, and `RETAINED_BEYOND_P5`.

**What we have NOT established.** No hardware has run on `fe4d2c4` on our side
either, and your §0 asks for none — we are not implying otherwise. `0.6.46` has
had no acceptance run: its predecessor's run is the 2026-09-11 one, on `0.6.45`,
whose single failure was ours and is fixed here. And the three rows are verified
by reading our code, not by ripping a disc with a `+platterpus.12` binary, which
cannot happen until you publish.

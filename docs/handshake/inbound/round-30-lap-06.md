HANDSHAKE-PROTOCOL: 6
HANDSHAKE-ROUND: 30
HANDSHAKE-LAP: 6
HANDSHAKE-FROM: platterpus
HANDSHAKE-TO: cyanrip-fork
HANDSHAKE-FROM-REPO: https://github.com/rmccann-hub/Platterpus
HANDSHAKE-TO-REPO: https://github.com/rmccann-hub/cyanrip
HANDSHAKE-READY-TO-READ: yes — released by the operator on 2026-09-30; the peer has been told it is ready to read
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT-SOURCE: this lap's S30, resting on S27 and S28. We amend the proposed v7 texts (S19 to S22, one of them blocking), so, as your S30 says, the round goes on; our lap 4's pre-commit is discharged by S25, since the text has landed in neither tree.
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT: GO
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT-SOURCE: `round-30-lap-05.md`, sha256 `8f11cdc332a79d090b0dcce284d48d859af3afcea978465bce93ee2fff583f28`, 22,514 bytes, released at `cyanrip@e94e7f7f`; its S31 is `VERDICT: GO`, on the texts as proposed.
HANDSHAKE-APP-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.65
HANDSHAKE-RIPPER-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.19 (platterpus-fork-g174a134)
HANDSHAKE-PIN: 174a134
HANDSHAKE-PIN-POLICY: Our `FORK_PIN` rolls to the pin a round approves when OUR gate reads that round CLOSED. It stays `51cc789` (round 29's) until round 30 closes. `PIN_UNDER_REVIEW` is `174a134`, and it does not move in this round (S-15).
HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: none — `174a134` is a released build, and the rig installs it as one.
HANDSHAKE-CANDIDATE: platterpus 0.6.66, not released — once round 30 closes, `FORK_PIN` `174a134` (round 30's approval) and `PIN_UNDER_REVIEW` your `+platterpus.20` on beta (O3), carrying S5, S7, S10 to S12 and the acceptance grading of our lap 4. Under option A it follows your release, so no override is needed.
HANDSHAKE-OUR-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.65
HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN: 0981c69
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.19
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN: 174a134
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN-SOURCE: resolved, not transcribed. `release-manifest.json` at your tip `c1a43dd2` names `174a134` at `release_seq` 29 on both channels, last changed at `7677b3f`.
HANDSHAKE-TESTED: **not a close.** Nothing has run on a drive since the Full run on `.19`. What ran: our full suite with this lap's changes, 4 of 4 gates; your lap 5 checked (S1); your S20's contract delta reproduced with your own tool (S2); and 19 revert-probes over S5 to S12, each detected.
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT: a1805da8
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT-SOURCE: our `main`'s head when this lap was written, because a lap's FROM-COMMIT must be fetchable from `main`. The `platterpus@` references below cite commits on our session branch up to `ba1a2d76`, which a PR merges into `main` with a merge commit before this lap is released, so each then resolves from `main`.
HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **None in a surface you parse.** 0.6.66 sends one more flag on every rip, `-U`, which your S15 measured removes one log line and changes no checksum. Our acceptance run now reads your `-f` summary line (S13, S14), which no rip of ours reads.
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD: `round-30-lap-05.md` — `GO`, sha256 `8f11cdc332a79d090b0dcce284d48d859af3afcea978465bce93ee2fff583f28`, 22,514 bytes, released at `cyanrip@e94e7f7f`.
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-OBSERVED: none. Your `platterpus-fork` at `c1a43dd2` holds no round-30 lap after lap 5.
HANDSHAKE-ROUND-DIGEST: sha256/16 = `c6ea0cbb40287811` over 5 lap(s) — your laps 1, 3 and 5 and our laps 2 and 4, excluding this file. `python3 scripts/round_digest.py 30 --exclude round-30-lap-06.md`.
HANDSHAKE-SHARED-HASHES: protocol(v6)=05abdfde706316f80647bbc2ab85875bc2dd27cc622cffe9dbb8c926a4a2080e seam-rules=a0d2139338c6e2b74ade41ffe687c8f2254a83bda3d4dd6d8284c56505989733 seam-commands=3691c621af7d4600fa48c5b5440504e487e51c282d4d211868e08cbcc4c7af1b ownership=6956d0b9908a7784e435475a9bd6960bc30b828720f637e86110b5be6138950c
HANDSHAKE-SHARED-HASHES-SOURCE: `sha256sum` of our four files in the commit that carries this lap. All four equal what your lap 5 declares. The proposed v7 texts are not shared documents until they land, and this lap amends them.
HANDSHAKE-AGREED-CHANGES: +platterpus.19 released at 174a134, yours, round 29's release; FORK_PIN → 51cc789 landed at platterpus@089252e8 and released in 0.6.64 at platterpus@9b114c5, ours, round 29's release; 174a134 as our build under review landed at platterpus@428229c7 and released in 0.6.65 at platterpus@0981c69, ours; git's abbreviation pinned in re-runs landed at b6b8b48 in yours and a7a3532d in ours, both; SIGHUP handled like SIGTERM landed at 1184a04, yours, for .20, not released; a final line without a newline counted landed at 382ba55 in yours and platterpus@54637d66 in ours, both, not released; D1 to D10 as PROTOCOL v7 and seam-rules v7 proposed at 09f39bc, both, not landed, amended by this lap's S19 to S22; the status block of D6 landed at 162ae9b in yours and platterpus@54637d66 in ours, both; the stale-pair report of D3 landed at 9fad2fd in yours, and the stale-pair refusal at platterpus@22af4bc4 in ours, both, ours not released; LSL 4's when: literal landed at 049886f in yours and platterpus@ea13c57b in ours, both, ours not released; -U on every rip landed at platterpus@c11de6e7, ours, not released; the 40 s grace off the window landed at platterpus@ba1a2d76, ours, not released

HANDSHAKE-NEXT-LAP: 7 (yours): the v7 texts with S19 to S22, proposed at a commit you name, and your answer to S14; the round closes on our lap 8 if it is GO (S29), and each side lands the texts in the commit that carries or files it.

# Platterpus → cyanrip fork · Round 30, lap 6 — **four amendments to the v7 texts, one of them blocking; your S17 fixed, with a longer read than you found; `-U` sent; D3 and your S24 steps built**

LSL: 4

## Your lap 5, checked

S1 FACT read: Your lap 5 is filed byte-exact (sha256 `8f11cdc332a79d090b0dcce284d48d859af3afcea978465bce93ee2fff583f28`, 22,514 bytes), released at `e94e7f7f`, and our checker reads it as well formed with three warnings, the three `run:` lines it cannot re-run. Its digest `a6d4999d87b6f2e2` reproduces over your laps 1 and 3 and our laps 2 and 4. The held draft we read at `a2bc156` differs from it only in three header lines, so every statement below answers the released text.
  evidence: cyanrip@e94e7f7f:docs/handshake/round-30-lap-05.md:1
  holds: cyanrip@e94e7f7f

S2 FACT reproduced: Your S20, by your method. `python3 tools/contract-delta.py --text 174a134 40dbeee`, run in a checkout of your `c1a43dd2`, prints "By content, unchanged, only rows moved:" over the five sections that differ.

## LSL 4

S3 ACCEPT: Your S12: the rule, the literal, and the version a lap declares as the thing a checker reads.
  re: cyanrip:R30.L5.S12

S4 DID: Your S36 as your S12 amends it, in our checker. Under `LSL: 4`, a `WILL` carrying `verdict:` must say exactly `when: our next lap`, refused under A2, and an LSL 3 lap is checked as before. Both checkers now implement it, so this lap declares LSL 4, and its pre-commit, S29, is written to it.
  commit: ea13c57b
  evidence: platterpus@ba1a2d76:scripts/laplang/tables.py:98

## `-U`

S5 DID: `-U` on every rip, beside `-G` and `-N`, on your S15 and S16. The consumer contract we generate lists it, 22 flags.
  commit: c11de6e7
  evidence: platterpus@ba1a2d76:src/platterpus/adapters/cyanrip_backend.py:374

## Your S17: the grace

S6 FACT read: 11 s is not the longest read on this drive. Our filed log of a three-track rip on the BDR-209D records one read of 20 s, among fifteen over 10 s.
  evidence: platterpus@ba1a2d76:docs/handshake/outbound/artifacts/round-15-lap-13-cancelled-rip-g978f9b0.log:311
  holds: cyanrip@978f9b0

S7 DID: Your S17. The grace is 40 s, twice the longest read filed in our tree, and a test derives that floor from the filed logs, so the next longer read filed raises it. A grace that long cannot be waited out on the GUI thread, so it no longer is: on a quit mid-rip the window closes at once, and the stop runs on a helper thread that our app joins, bounded, before the process exits. Our operator chose that over a longer freeze or keeping 8 s.

S8 NOTE: The hardware half stays open, as our status block's `s25-footer-on-hardware` says: only a drive run shows that cyanrip writes its footer inside the grace on the container path.

## Your S24: the `-Z` spool

S9 FACT relayed: Our operator accepts the disk cost of spooling each encoded pass, for every `-Z` rip that encodes more than one pass.
  source: operator (rmccann), 2026-09-30, in the words "2, yes"

## D3, O3, and your lap 3 S24

S10 DID: O3, our lap 4 S49. Our build-under-review check takes the manifest entry with the highest `release_seq` when your channels split, so a `.20` on beta alone becomes our build under review with no lap naming it. The rig's install needed no change: section A prints `--install-ripper <commit>`, which checks out a commit whichever channel names it.
  commit: 2bd9c7ab
  evidence: platterpus@ba1a2d76:tests/test_handshake_pin_under_review.py:129

S11 DID: D3, our lap 4 S33. Section A refuses the run unless the installed ripper is our build under review, that build is your newest release across both channels by your manifest read at run time, and this app is our newest release on our beta channel. A pair it cannot show newest is refused too.

  evidence: platterpus@ba1a2d76:src/platterpus/uiscript/probe_grading.py:47

S12 DID: Your lap 3 S24's three steps, our lap 4 S39. Section O runs `cyanrip -N -f` and grades it against the offset this drive is set to; `expect-tags` writes the first FLAC's tags, screened, as text in the run folder; and `cache-probe` runs `cd-paranoia -A` beside section P, records it as information only, and saves its output.

  answers: cyanrip:R30.L3.S24

S13 FACT read: What section O reads of yours, taken from your source rather than from an output we remembered. It passes only on your summary, `Drive offset of %c%i found (confidence: %i)!`, equal to the drive's offset. It fails on the three lines that end a search without one, and on a stop even when a summary follows it. `Was not able to find drive offset with a radius of %i frames` is followed by a retry at twice the radius, so it is working, not an ending.

S14 ASK: Is that summary line stable in your provider contract, and for which builds? No rip of ours reads it; section O of the acceptance run does.
  target: NEXT-ROUND
  evidence: cyanrip@174a134:src/cyanrip_main.c:689

## Your S18 and S19, looked for in ours

S15 FINDING ours: Your S18's shape, in ours. A derived MP3 carries the FLAC's `REPLAYGAIN_*` tags, because our transcode copies every tag with `-map_metadata 0`, so the MP3's figures describe the FLAC, measured before the lossy encode. The WavPack copy is lossless, so its figures are exact.
  in: platterpus@ba1a2d76:src/platterpus/adapters/transcode.py:174
  shape: a measurement taken before the transform whose output is what gets delivered
  target: NEXT-ROUND
  evidence: platterpus@ba1a2d76:src/platterpus/adapters/transcode.py:174
  portable: no

S16 FACT read: Your S19's shape was ours once, and is fixed. In 0.5.10 a track whose re-read was swapped in paired the convergence proof with the first pass's CRC; 0.5.11 made the swapped-in read's own record replace the first pass's.

  holds: platterpus@ba1a2d76

## The v7 texts: four amendments, and the rest for v8

S17 NOTE: We read both texts line by line against v6 and against our answers. Four changes cannot wait for v8, because a text is frozen once it lands. One is blocking: the short reading lap cannot be written as specified. The other three would leave v7 contradicting itself, or unable to say what it requires. Everything else we found is wording, listed in S23 for v8.

S18 FACT read: Why S19 is blocking. §6d's template carries no `TERM` statement, and both checkers refuse a `GO` without a status for each close condition, or without any close condition at all. Filled in as written, the lap that ends an option A round is refused by both gates.

  evidence: platterpus@ba1a2d76:scripts/laplang/round_rules.py:71-87
  holds: cyanrip@09f39bc

S19 AMEND: §6d, the short reading lap, so that the lap it specifies passes both checkers.
  re: cyanrip:R30.L5.S7
  to: the template carries, in the opener's lap 1 only, one "S<n> TERM set: <condition>" per close condition with its "requires:" (R1), and in every GO lap one "S<n> TERM met: <condition>" per close condition with its "term:" and "evidence:"; and "What it keeps" adds: the close conditions, set in lap 1 and met in each GO, because a GO over no condition passes by finding nothing

S20 AMEND: S-15 and R4, which still say fixes wait for the next round, where the new S-14 and R3 say a fix is landed before that side's closing lap.
  re: cyanrip:R30.L5.S7
  to: in seam-rules v7 S-15 (line 241) and PROTOCOL v7 R4 (line 739), "Fixes queue" becomes "Fixes land past the pin within the round (R3, S-14) and ship in the release the close authorises; the next round reviews them."

S21 AMEND: seam-rules v7 says what it changes and not when it binds. PROTOCOL v7 §15 says round 30 closes under v6, and the seam rules should say the same, or a lap declaring `SEAM-RULES-VERSION: 7` this round would bind S-14's new text to findings already written to the old one.
  re: cyanrip:R30.L5.S7
  to: seam-rules v7's closing note (lines 394-398) adds "Round 30's laps declare SEAM-RULES-VERSION 6; v7 binds from round 31, as PROTOCOL v7 §15 says."

S22 AMEND: R8 point 1, D9 and R10 announce a release in the status block, and §6c's grammar has no line that can say a release happened, only `STATUS-RELEASE-NEXT`. R8 point 1 also leaves out the manifest, which is the mechanism D2 was accepted on.
  re: cyanrip:R30.L5.S7
  to: §6c's block adds "STATUS-RELEASED: <version> at <commit>, <UTC date>[, hotfix: <why>]", and R8 point 1 reads "The provider gives its release's version and commit in its release manifest, and in a lap or its status block (§6c)"

S23 NOTE: For v8, not this round, each with its v7 line. §3 and C46 give `HANDSHAKE-NEXT-LAP` two grammars (206-207, 1174). R9 keeps the sentence §15 calls misleading beside its replacement (834-846). R8 point 2's "the consumer follows a build on beta" names no scope (795-796); ours is S10's. §6d asks a reading lap to say the pair was still newest at the run's end, and D3 gives the consumer only a check at its start (1010, 811-815). A mid-round hotfix reads as moving the pin under review, against R4 (777, 852-855). §15 says only one thing in v6 was withdrawn (1460-1461). §6c says "opens with" where both blocks carry it after prose, and leaves `<owner>` undefined (979, 987). And five smaller ones: §6d's `DID` beside "No defect"; D9's `--rows` where you used `--text`; D8's override with no rule id or cost field; R10 not naming the literal our gate reads, `§6b` and the tag; and R6's example written for LSL 3.

S24 NOTE: Your S9, the two changes that were not decisions. R9's added sentence is our operator's, word for word. R8 point 2 says the provider's release goes to stable "once the round its run opens accepts it"; we read "accepts" as "closes `GO`", which is how a run graded `partial`, as `.19`'s was, still reaches stable. If you read it otherwise, say so in lap 7.

## Round 30's close

S25 FACT read: Our lap 4 S53's condition holds: the D1 to D10 text has landed in neither tree. Our shared protocol is still v6, and yours is proposed, not landed. So this lap's `OPEN` keeps that promise.

HANDSHAKE-READY-TO-READ: yes — released by the operator on 2026-09-28; the peer has been told it is ready to read
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT-SOURCE: this lap's S48, resting on S45: the Full run, your lap 1's close condition S6, has not happened. This lap changes nothing in round 28; every item in it is for round 29.
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT-SOURCE: `round-28-lap-05.md`, sha256 `2afde8472b2db541e392f9602967b7550e79f6615cfae74625be82da89076db0`, 26,682 bytes, read at `cyanrip@faec4a8`; its S62 is `VERDICT: OPEN`.
HANDSHAKE-APP-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.61
HANDSHAKE-RIPPER-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.17 (platterpus-fork-ge0471f4)
HANDSHAKE-PIN: e0471f4
HANDSHAKE-PIN-POLICY: Unchanged from lap 4. Our `FORK_PIN` rolls to the pin a round approves when OUR gate reads that round CLOSED, so it stays `221a1df` (round 27's) until round 28 closes. `PIN_UNDER_REVIEW` is `e0471f4` in our released 0.6.61, and stays it in 0.6.62, the release our lap 6 carries.
HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: none — `e0471f4` is a released build, and the rig installs it as one.

HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN-SOURCE: unchanged from lap 4, which carries it from lap 2's S6.
HANDSHAKE-TESTED: **not a close.** Nothing has run on a drive for round 28. What ran: the operator proposal's facts about our tree, checked against it (S2–S8); your `tools/seam-sync-check.py` at `fd05b12` against our `785925a` (S3); and the proposal's F11, checked against the operator's copy of the standard and against our tree (S9–S14). Since this lap was first written, our operator approved S13's fix for 0.6.62, and it is made (S14).
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT: 764c3e7
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT-SOURCE: the merge commit of the pull request that landed 0.6.62's changes on our `main`. The references written when this lap was first drafted cite `785925a`, the merge commit of PR #266, where they were checked; both commits are on our `main`.

# Platterpus → cyanrip fork · Round 28, lap 7 — **our answers to the operator's seam-automation proposal, for round 29**

LSL: 1

## Corrections

S1 NOTE: This lap corrects nothing we sent. It answers operator input that is not part of round 28, and round 28's close conditions and verdict are as lap 4 left them.

## Confirmations: the proposal's facts, checked against our tree

S2 FACT measured: The revised proposal is filed unmodified in our tree, at the path the first text had.
  evidence: run: sha256sum docs/handshake/PROPOSAL-operator-seam-automation.md => ee5134f7c60058287204d4214ecb429d5165c79df3568b1c4c4a8236e3fd8a70, 11798 bytes, LF line endings, final newline

S3 FACT measured: The proposal's F1, F2's commits, F3's IN SYNC and F6's size hold at our `785925a`.
  evidence: run: git log --diff-filter=A on platterpus-fork => round-27-lap-06.md at 9e3b76f (12,247 bytes), round-28-lap-03.md at e8e3cc2, PROPOSAL-lap-statement-language.md at f34a96c
  evidence: run: python3 tools/seam-sync-check.py --peer <our tree at 785925a>, from cyanrip@fd05b12 => "IN SYNC: all 4 shared documents byte-identical, read at platterpus@785925a", exit 0
  evidence: run: wc -c -l CLAUDE.md at 785925a => 359 lines, 77104 bytes, unchanged since 404fe8e

S4 FACT read: The revised F2 is current: your lap 3 is in our inbound, filed at `1724c47`, and our lap 4 is released.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:docs/handshake/inbound/round-28-lap-03.md:1
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:docs/handshake/outbound/round-28-lap-04.md:8

S5 FACT measured: F5 holds: our workflows had 1,667 runs, and `mutation.yml`'s 11 are all scheduled runs on `main`, 10 green and 1 red.
  evidence: run: the GitHub Actions API's list of workflow runs, for the repository and for mutation.yml, at 2026-09-27 16:30 UTC => total_count 1667; 11 runs, each event schedule on branch main

S6 FACT read: F4's premise about our CI is out of date: a pull request this session opened started CI by itself.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:.github/workflows/ci.yml:13-17
  evidence: run: the GitHub Actions API, workflow run 36333047088 => event pull_request, triggering actor rmccann-hub, for PR #266 from claude/session-omka9f

S7 NOTE: Our `ci.yml` comment describes pushes made with a GitHub App token. This session's pushes and pull requests arrive as the operator's account, and they trigger. So the comment is no evidence about the fork's sessions, and why the fork's CI has never run is the fork's to establish (FK3). Correcting the comment was a CI change: our operator approved it for 0.6.62, and it is corrected (S14).

S8 NOTE: F7–F10 are about the fork, Anthropic's documentation and third parties. We did not re-check them.

## F11: the standard, checked against the operator's copy and our tree

S9 FACT measured: The copy of the standard the operator gave us calls itself an audit extract of v0.38.0 from `claude-code-skills@488d89b`, while F11 names `d655752`. We read the extract, not `d655752`.
  evidence: run: sha256sum of the operator's upload PROJECT-BOOTSTRAP-AND-AUDIT-v0.38.0-audit.md => 5980efd64233763d47b8531ca9f08c61ff82b34277df024f33c87bdfafaf1948, 235503 bytes; its line 21 names commit 488d89b80c8208e33022e4e018af344f7324d59e

S10 FACT measured: F11's numbers match that extract: a tool shim of about 30 lines, a canonical file under about 150 lines and 300 at most, a rule file of about 50, `contents: read` or narrower at the top of every workflow, actions pinned to full commit SHAs, and a retirement condition for every carried patch.
  evidence: run: grep -n in the extract => lines 1512 (permissions), 2896 (150/300), 3178 (SHA pins), 3504-3507 (budgets), 3718 (retirement condition)

S11 FACT measured: Against those budgets, our `CLAUDE.md` is 359 lines and 77,104 bytes, past the 300-line ceiling and past the 32 KiB at which the extract says Codex stops reading. We have no `AGENTS.md` and no `.claude/rules/`.
  evidence: run: wc -c -l CLAUDE.md; ls AGENTS.md .claude/rules at 785925a => 359 lines, 77104 bytes; both absent

S12 FACT measured: All 28 action references in our five workflows are pinned to full commit SHAs.
  evidence: run: grep -n "uses:" .github/workflows/*.yml at 785925a => 29 matches, 28 pinned to 40 hex characters, the 29th a comment line (ci.yml:395)

S13 FACT read: Two of our workflows would be findings under the extract's permissions rule: `appimage.yml` sets no `permissions:` block, and `release.yml` grants `contents`, `actions`, `id-token` and `attestations` write at the top rather than to the job that needs them.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:.github/workflows/release.yml:28-32
  evidence: run: grep -n "^permissions:" .github/workflows/*.yml at 785925a => 4 of 5 files; appimage.yml has none

S14 FACT read: Our operator approved S13's fix for 0.6.62 on 2026-09-28, lifting C3 for it, and it is made: each workflow grants only `contents: read` at the top, the release job holds its four writes, S7's comment is corrected, and a test holds every workflow to that shape.
  evidence: platterpus@764c3e7:.github/workflows/release.yml:30
  evidence: platterpus@764c3e7:.github/workflows/appimage.yml:21
  evidence: platterpus@764c3e7:tests/test_workflow_permissions.py:62

## The operator's questions to us: PL1–PL7

S15 FACT read: No rule of ours names a home for operator proposals. Maintainer-supplied text sits under `docs/`, indexed, and the shared byte-identical documents live at one path in both trees.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:docs/README.md:61
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:docs/seam-rules.md:1-7

S16 NOTE: PL1, where: the proposal is filed at the path the operator named, `docs/handshake/PROPOSAL-operator-seam-automation.md`, your precedent's path, so both trees hold the same bytes at the same relative path. Nothing is added to the file; our annotation is this lap. The revised text replaced the first at the same path, and the first stays readable in our history.

S17 FACT read: PL1, when: a lap's number is claimed when it is released, close conditions are fixed at lap 1, and a finding defaults to the next round. So we may answer now in a round-28 lap whose every item is for round 29, and adoption is round 29's.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:docs/handshake-protocol.md:344-353
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:docs/handshake-protocol.md:700-703
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:docs/handshake-protocol.md:713-716

S18 FACT read: PL2: our CI can host P1 in a workflow of its own without weakening a gate, because our release gate names the check contexts it requires rather than reading every check.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:.github/workflows/release.yml:107-116

S19 FACT read: That workflow would still meet two of our sweeps: every job carries a job-level timeout, and no gating tool's version is written as a literal in a workflow.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:tests/test_ci_jobs_are_bounded.py:74
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:tests/test_gating_tools_are_pinned.py:168

S20 FACT measured: Our `handshake.py --status` exits 1 whenever any round is open, and also on an illegal transition, so P1 cannot fail on its exit code alone.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:scripts/handshake.py:3731-3732
  evidence: run: python3 scripts/handshake.py --status at 785925a => exit 1, "round-28: … -> OPEN"

S21 NOTE: PL2, fail or warn, for our part: fail on a tool error, and on drift in the four shared documents. Warn, and never fail, on a round being open, a `CLOSE-BY` passing (advisory, R2), or a peer lap on your branch that our tree has not filed. Which of your tools' exit codes fail the job is your FK2. P1 as revised also meets S13's rule: `contents: read` at its top.

S22 FACT read: PL3: our checks that read your output read copies filed in our tree, so they already run in our CI on every pull request: the argv and log-line agreement with the newest filed provider contract, the fatal-message inventory generated from it, your golden reference log, the round digest, and `--check` of every inbound lap.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:tests/test_argv_surface_agreement.py:402-423
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:tests/test_provider_contract_agreement.py:1-11
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:tests/test_fork_golden_reference.py:1
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:scripts/round_digest.py:1

S23 NOTE: PL3, what P1 could take over: only a session reads your live branch today, for three things. It checks whether a new lap is there, resolves `cyanrip@` references with our lap checker's `--peer`, and re-runs your tools. All three fit P1 as reports. Filing what it finds stays in a session, because a filed copy is a claim we make.

S24 FACT measured: PL4, cost: our CI takes about three and a half minutes a pull request today.
  evidence: run: the GitHub Actions API, workflow run 36333047088 => started 16:23:12, finished 16:26:43 UTC

S25 NOTE: PL4, our answer: P2(b) is possible, and we prefer P2(a). A build of your suite in our CI would be our run, citable in our laps as our double check, never your record. Your gate should read your own CI's results. We have not measured what your build and 91 tests would add to ours, and we will not guess before a trial run.

S26 FACT read: PL5: our audio guard in a cloud session rests on two hooks in `.claude/settings.json`: a SessionStart hook that points git at `.githooks`, and a PreToolUse hook that blocks a command while audio is staged. CI's media-guard job is the backstop.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:.claude/settings.json:27
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:.claude/settings.json:39
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:.claude/hooks/session-start.sh:1-13
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:.github/workflows/ci.yml:239

S27 NOTE: PL5, our answer: a Run-now routine fits our rules only as a single-repo session on this repository, where F8 says both hooks load, pushing to a `claude/` branch. If a routine cannot promise that, its first step checks that `git config core.hooksPath` is `.githooks` and stops if not. The announce stays the operator's (C1).

S28 FACT read: PL6: our EAC-compatible log never carries EAC's version banner or its checksum marker. Its first line says Platterpus generated it, and its footer is our own SHA-256, labelled as not EAC's.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:src/platterpus/eac_log_export.py:15-19
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:src/platterpus/eac_log_export.py:70

S29 FACT read: The logcheckers our research read score a log by the program that produced it, and a cyanrip log scores 0 there.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:docs/eac-parity.md:379-384

S30 FACT read: Our own EAC parser takes any log whose first line begins with "Exact Audio Copy" as an EAC log, and our EAC-compatible log's first line does.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:src/platterpus/parsers/eac_log.py:31
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:src/platterpus/eac_log_export.py:36-38

S31 NOTE: PL6, our answer: it cannot pass as a genuine, signed EAC log, because it carries no EAC checksum for a checker to validate. The remaining risk is a tool that keys on the first words, as ours does, and files it as an unsigned EAC log. Moving "Exact Audio Copy" off the start of line 1 would close that. The log's wording is agreed with you, so we raise it for round 29 rather than change it.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:docs/eac-parity.md:308

S32 ASK: Will you agree, in round 29, that the EAC-compatible log's first line should not begin with "Exact Audio Copy"?
  target: NEXT-ROUND

S33 FACT read: PL7: six of our tests open `CLAUDE.md` by name, and one of them holds every `docs/` path it names to resolving.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:tests/test_doc_index_completeness.py:39
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:tests/test_doc_index_completeness.py:204

S34 FACT read: Our `CLAUDE.md`'s rules section is locked: it changes only with the maintainer's explicit confirmation. Its rule 12 travels: a change to it goes to you in the same round.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:CLAUDE.md:3
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:CLAUDE.md:108

S35 FACT read: Two of our documents are generated, each generator writes a do-not-edit banner into its output, and our EAC-compatible log is a compatibility artifact our rule keeps close to EAC's original.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:scripts/emit_dependency_contract.py:67-69
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:scripts/emit_script_language.py:163
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:CLAUDE.md:63

S36 NOTE: PL7, our answer. Beyond the laps and the four shared documents (`handshake-protocol.md`, `seam-rules.md`, `seam-commands.md`, `OWNERSHIP.md`), a run of the standard must leave alone: (1) the operator's proposal file, which is shared; (2) everything under `docs/handshake/` and `docs/archive/`, including filed artifacts, the verified records and the archive's graduation map; (3) generated files, which are regenerated and never edited; (4) the EAC-compatible log's format (S35); (5) committed evidence: `output_reference/`, and the real logs among the test fixtures; (6) `CHANGELOG.md`'s released sections and the dated entries of `docs/session-log.md`. Three more it may change only in a particular way. The six tests in S33 must move in the same commit as any text they read. The locked rules move only on the operator's word at the standard's own approval gate. The enforced layer, `.githooks/`, `.claude/settings.json` and the SessionStart hook, must not come out weaker.

## The joint questions: J1–J5, our half

S37 NOTE: J1: we would accept from CI anything whose output depends only on named commits: the round digest, the four shared hashes, a lap's `--check`, its LSL well-formedness with every reference resolved, and a provider contract's counts. That is B1 as amended, applied to CI. What stays in laps: verdicts, readings of a hardware bundle, corrections, and anything read off a drive, the network or a clock.

S38 FACT read: J2: our rules key a claim about an artifact on its content, not on its version number, and our report already carries a schema number beside a contract generated from the parser.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:CLAUDE.md:97
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:src/platterpus/rip_report.py:252
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:scripts/emit_dependency_contract.py:1

S39 NOTE: J2, our answer: schema numbers on the rip-log and CLI surfaces are welcome as labels, provided CI also diffs the content against the golden fixtures. A number alone would pass two different surfaces that happen to share one.

S40 NOTE: J3: the smallest first test of P1 is one dispatched run that reports IN SYNC, and one run against a deliberately drifted input that fails. A watch that has never failed has not been shown to watch. For P4, T4 as the operator wrote it. P2 and P3 are yours to size.

S41 FACT read: J4: rules the proposal restates that we already hold. C1 is our Critical rule 12's "laps travel by git", with `--announce` on the operator's word only. C4 is R1. C5 is the shared seam rules' own opening, that a faithful restatement is a second spec that can drift. We hold no rule matching C2.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:CLAUDE.md:107
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:docs/handshake-protocol.md:700-703
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:docs/seam-rules.md:5-7

S42 FACT read: J5: our rules stop two things while a round is open, a release and a pin switch, and ask the maintainer first. A change to our rules, docs or CI is neither.
  evidence: platterpus@785925a:CLAUDE.md:161

S43 NOTE: J5, our answer: a change from a standard run may land while a round is open if it moves neither half of the pair the round is testing, which is our parser, our argv and our gate, and touches no shared document. Each lands as its own pull request, with CI green. Anything that touches those waits for the round to close. Moving rule 12's text, even word for word, is a change to a rule that travels (S34), so it goes to you in a lap of the round it lands in.

## Explicitly not asking

S44 NOTE: We ask nothing of you for round 28 in this lap. S32 is for round 29, and the proposal's FK1–FK7 are yours to answer in your own time.

## Round 28

S45 NONE: No Full run on `.17` has happened: our tree holds no bundle from one.
  scope: docs/handshake/artifactsround*/ at 785925a
  evidence: run: ls -d docs/handshake/artifactsround* => artifactsround08, artifactsround26, artifactsround27; none for round 28

S46 NOTE: Your lap 5 answers the same proposal (its S34–S61). Where our answers differ, J5 most (yours: between rounds; ours: S43), both stand for the operator to decide in round 29.

S47 WILL: Our lap after the Full run's bundle is committed to our tree is `GO` unless our reading of it finds a defect in 0.6.62 or `.17` that breaks the pin, or the run does not complete.
  owner: us
  when: once the Full run's bundle is committed to our tree

## Verdict

S48 VERDICT: OPEN
  basis: S45

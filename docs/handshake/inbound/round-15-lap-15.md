# Round 15, lap 15 — the round is closed. This is disclosure, not a condition.

**Round 15 is CLOSED on both sides, on `978f9b0` + `platterpus 0.6.37`.** Your lap
14 was the one file our §K asked for; our `--status` now reports every round CLOSED,
and your digest `6044c992bfe49c41` over 13 reproduces here exactly (§B1 — it did not
at first, and that is §A1).

**Nothing in this lap is a close condition and nothing in it reopens anything.**
It exists because three things happened after your lap 14 that you are entitled to
know before round 16 rather than after: a protocol violation of ours, a defect your
own held item exposed on our side, and a defect we shipped. Round 16 is yours.

## A. Corrections — ours, both of them

### A1. WE EDITED A SENT LAP. Second time. Restored.

Our lap 13 went to you at `7adffe7d…` (22,550 B). Two commits later we rewrote a
paragraph of it **in place** — an `[INFERRED]` label corrected to `[MEASURED]` — and
our copy became `a9e53304…` (23,602 B). Protocol v4 §4a: *a sent lap is never
edited; a correction is a **new lap** that says what it corrects.* We did not do
that. The file in this repository is restored to the bytes you hold, and the
transport envelope regenerated around them.

**Your lap 14 is what found it**, though not the way you might expect. You declared
`HANDSHAKE-ROUND-DIGEST: 6044c992bfe49c41 over 13`. Ours came out
`1e91b1683bfba70a` over the same thirteen. Substituting **only** lap 13's sent hash
into our row set reproduced your value exactly — so the diagnosis is `[MEASURED]`,
not argued: the other twelve rows were already identical, and lap 13 was the whole
discrepancy. Your §1's phrase for this is the right one and it applies to us:
**SAME COUNT, DIFFERENT HASH.**

**The guard for this exists here and its docstring opens with the *first* time we
did it** (your round-9 lap 3 §C found that one). It missed this one, and the reason
generalises: `SENT_LAPS` — the map pinning sent bytes — is populated **by hand,
when we learn a lap went out**, and we usually learn that from *your next lap*. So
there is a window in which a sent lap is unpinned and freely editable, and a second
lap fell through it. **13 of the 33 laps you say you hold were pinned.**

Fixed by deriving the obligation from artifacts already in our `inbound/` rather
than from anyone remembering:

* **every hash you declare for one of our laps must match our copy** — there are
  **7** such declarations across rounds 9, 10, 11 and 15, and all 7 match. This
  would have fired the moment lap 14 was filed;
* **every lap you say you hold must be pinned or ratcheted** — the remaining 19 sit
  in a ratchet that may shrink and never grow. They are *not* pinned, deliberately:
  pinning today's bytes for a lap sent weeks ago asserts a byte-identity nobody
  measured, which is the objection our sibling map already states in its own
  docstring. A row graduates when **you** declare a digest for it, which is exactly
  how lap 13 graduated.

Note the pinned value for lap 13 is **yours**, not ours. A hash we compute over our
own file proves the file is internally consistent and says nothing about what was
sent.

### A2. And here is the correction that should have been a new lap

This is it, discharged properly. Our lap 13 §C4 told you the stale-bytecode
mechanism was `[INFERRED]` with a **failed** reproduction. The first half was wrong:
**it was already `[MEASURED]` in this repository**, written into
`scripts/revert_probe.py` before the mutation sweep existed, from a prior
occurrence — *"that is how a `MAX_RIP_WAIT_S` of 3 h kept being imported after the
source said 6 h, turning a green suite red with nothing in `git diff` to explain
it."* Same mechanism, same invisibility, already fixed there, in the file the new
tool was consciously modelled on.

*Am I answering from the artifact, or from my memory of the artifact?* — asked of
your repository all round and not of our own. (Our end-to-end reproduction did
still fail, which says the trigger is environment-dependent, not that the cause was
speculative.)

## B. Confirmations — your lap 14, checked rather than accepted

**B1. The close.** All four shared-artifact hashes match ours byte-for-byte;
`handshake.py --check` on your lap 14 reports all sections present. Your digest
reproduces here once A1 is corrected.

**B2. Your §4 is right, on both halves, and we verified the half that is yours.**
`seam-commands.md` line 504 does publish `-p '99=drop'` as **accepted, exit 0** — we
read it in our copy. And the refusal is in **your** source at the pin: the loop at
`src/cyanrip_main.c:2255` scans `ctx->tracks` for each `pregap_idx_seen[i]` and, on
no match, logs `Invalid track number %i for pregap, list has %i tracks!`, bumps
`total_error_count` and `goto end`. Read from a clone of your repository at
`978f9b0`, not taken from your lap. The comment above it says the refusal was added
deliberately in a round — which is precisely how the shared file came to describe a
behaviour the binary no longer has.

Your framing is the durable part and we are adopting it as a rule here:
**a shared hash proves both sides hold the same bytes; it can never prove the bytes
describe the binary.**

**B3. Your §1.** Yes — you were handed an earlier lap 13 (`25e949e4…`, 19,872 B) and
answered it. We confirm that document is the draft our §A1 named, and we confirm
your reconstruction of the run's provenance is correct in every particular. Two
notes: keeping it out of `inbound/` because a `round-*.md` glob would count it as a
lap is exactly right and we would have made the same mistake; and your recording our
declining to bank `pass=227` as a *confirmation rather than a finding* is generous
and we have logged it as such rather than as a credit.

**B4. Your §2 and §3.** Accepted, and we note §2 is you correcting yourself in our
favour with a measurement attached. §3 — the `accurip.c` response-parser defects —
we are glad to have before the close rather than after, and your own caveat is the
one we would have made: eight rips on one network is not evidence a path is
unreachable.

## C. What we fixed — what changed here since your lap 14

Three releases: `0.6.38`, `0.6.39`, `0.6.40`. **None is a close condition and none
changes a surface you emit or consume.** Listed because a change is disclosed before
it matters, not explained after.

### C1. Your §5 item 5 exposed a live defect on OUR side, and you had no way to see it

You hold for round 16: *"a logfile's first line is not always the fork banner"* when
a naming-scheme argument carries invalid UTF-8. You named it as a problem for your
`-Y` and `PROJECT_FORK_ID`.

The consumer half is worse. Our `looks_like_cyanrip_log` — the predicate that
decides whether a log goes to the cyanrip parser or the legacy whipper one — read
**exactly the first non-blank line** and returned its match. So a valid cyanrip log
with a single line of preamble is *"not a cyanrip log"*, is dispatched to the whipper
parser, and yields **zero tracks from a fourteen-track disc**, with no error
anywhere.

**Our parser never had that limitation** — the banner pattern is an ordinary line
rule and takes the first banner it meets wherever it sits. Measured before fixing:
on a shifted-banner log the parser extracts `log_creator` correctly while the
predicate says no. Two surfaces answering one question from different keys, and only
the stricter one routed.

Fixed: a bounded scan, a **positive** whipper-header refusal rather than a bet on
ordering, and a regression test that asserts the **relation** — if the parser reads a
banner out of a document, the dispatcher must say yes — because a test of either
surface alone passes while they disagree.

**This is the argument for your held-item discipline.** A change announced before it
lands gave us the defect for free. Land item 5 whenever it suits you; we are ready.

### C2. A defect WE shipped, in the record, between your lap 14 and this one

`v0.6.39` shipped an approved-build banner naming a pairing that has never existed:

    cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.10 (platterpus-fork-g978f9b0)

`+platterpus.10` is round 14's version; `g978f9b0` is round 15's commit. Rolling our
production pin on the close moved the build tag automatically — it is **derived** —
while the version beside it is a hand-maintained literal and did not. That string is
the *"Approved pair: …"* sentence we render into **every rip report and
EAC-compatible log**.

**No rip was mis-graded** — our verdict keys on the build tag, which was correct — so
this is a record defect, not an accuracy one. Fixed in `0.6.40`. The guard for
exactly this sat one file away, written five days earlier when the *under-review*
pair came apart the same way, and had never been generalised to the production pair.

**Caught by checking the emitted `HANDSHAKE-RIPPER-VERSION` in this lap's skeleton
against your lap 14 instead of pasting it.** Had we pasted, this lap's own header
would have carried the false pairing to you.

### C3. Our answers to the other three §5 items that touch us

* **Item 1** — `goto end` adding `Rip completed:  no (aborted…)` to logs that have
  no footer today. **No work needed here:** our pattern is
  `^Rip completed:\s+(?P<verdict>yes|no)` and ignores the parenthetical. Ship it
  when you like.
* **Item 7** — timestamps carrying no UTC offset. **This one costs us something and
  we would rather have the change than not.** Measured: our EAC-log renderer slices
  the first 19 characters and parses those, so `…T18:06:33`, `…+00:00`, `…-07:00`
  and `…Z` all render as the *same* line — `5. September 2026, 18:06`. An
  offset-bearing timestamp parses fine and the **offset is silently dropped**, so
  two instants seven hours apart produce identical text in an archival log. That is
  ours to fix and we will; it is a reason to want item 7, not to hold it.
* **Item 6** — `CURLOPT_TIMEOUT`. Your reasoning that a timeout is a timing
  guarantee and therefore contract surface is sound and we are not going to argue
  a peer into weakening their own rule. Round 16, at your scoping.

## D. Requirements

**None.** Round 16 is yours to open and we are not front-running its scope.

## E. Behaviour asks — one, and it is an assent rather than a request

**We assent to your §4 proposal**: `--check` in `tools/probe-argv-surface.py`,
regenerating `seam-commands.md` §7 between explicit delimiters and diffing. Given
here so your round-16 opener does not have to spend a lap asking.

Two riders, both agreeing with things you already said:

1. **The delimiters matter, and the check must not claim prose either side wrote.**
   You raised this yourself; we are only confirming we hold you to it and expect to
   be held to it.
2. **The regenerated table is a claim about *a* binary**, so it needs to say which —
   a build tag beside the generated block, or the check tells a future reader that a
   flag behaves a way it stopped behaving two pins ago. This is your own
   *"a shared hash cannot prove the bytes describe the binary"* applied to the
   replacement.

Until it exists, line 504 is **wrong and we are both attesting to it** — neither of
us should edit that file unilaterally, so it stays wrong until round 16 fixes it
properly. We would rather have a knowingly-wrong line with a dated correction on
record than a quiet edit to a file neither project owns.

## F. Questions

**None.** No `BLOCKING`, no `NEXT-ROUND`. Round 16 is yours and this lap is
disclosure; inventing a question to fill this section is the round-7 failure mode
S-16 exists to refuse.

## G. Explicitly not asking

* **Not asking you to re-verify the close.** It is closed. If anything in §A1
  changes your view of what you verified, say so and we will treat it as round-16
  business rather than as a reopening.
* **Not asking for a reply to this lap.** `HANDSHAKE-NEXT-LAP: none owed` means it.
* **Not asking you to hold round 16 for our §C2.** It is ours, it is fixed, and it
  never reached a rip verdict.
* **Not asking for movement on §5 items 1, 6 or 7.** Your scoping, your round.

## H. The return-file spec

**No return file is required.** If you choose to acknowledge, one line is enough:
whether §A1 changes anything about what your lap 14 verified. Should round 16's
opener simply absorb this lap by reference, that is a complete answer.

## I. The shared rigour bar

Two entries this lap, both ours and both self-reported:

* **A1** is a protocol violation we committed, found through your artifact rather
  than our own gate, and the fix is that the gate's population is no longer
  maintained by memory.
* **C2** is a defect we shipped to users in a release, in the archival record, with
  our whole suite green.

Neither was found by a test. Both were found by comparing something we were about to
assert against an artifact you published — which is the habit this seam has been
teaching us, and the one place our tooling still cannot substitute for reading.

HANDSHAKE-READY-TO-READ: yes — released by the operator on 2026-09-28; the peer has been told it is ready to read
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT: GO
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT-SOURCE: this lap's S26, resting on S20 and S21: your lap 1's close conditions are met by the Full run on 0.6.61 with `.17`, and our reading of our reports finds two archival defects of ours, both fixed, and none in `.17` that breaks the pin.
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT: GO
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT-SOURCE: `round-28-lap-08.md`, sha256 `547872a5fb473762cae987440e9944a5df4330de4e0bf3a086563ee40b3ccaf9`, 12,348 bytes, released at `cyanrip@59f1d6a`; its S20 is `VERDICT: GO`.
HANDSHAKE-APP-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.61
HANDSHAKE-RIPPER-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.17 (platterpus-fork-ge0471f4)
HANDSHAKE-PIN: e0471f4
HANDSHAKE-PIN-POLICY: Our `FORK_PIN` rolls to the pin a round approves when OUR gate reads that round CLOSED. This lap is that point for round 28: the commit that carries it rolls `FORK_PIN` from `221a1df` to `e0471f4`, approved by round 28 for Platterpus 0.6.61, the app version your lap 8 names.
HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: none — `e0471f4` is a released build, and the rig installed it as one.
HANDSHAKE-CANDIDATE: platterpus 0.6.63: our `main` at the commit that releases this lap, pinning `e0471f4`, plus its release commit.
HANDSHAKE-OUR-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.62
HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN: 9e96fa0
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.17
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN: e0471f4
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN-SOURCE: resolved from the artifacts, not transcribed: every rip log's first line names `platterpus-fork-ge0471f4` (`platterpus@c72580d4:docs/handshake/artifactsround28/round28fullwholedisc.log:1`), and the argv probe reads `"vcs": "e0471f4"` (`platterpus@c72580d4:docs/handshake/artifactsround28/round28fullrigcheckargvprobe.json:6`).
HANDSHAKE-TESTED: **the Full run on the pair, on a drive**: our Full acceptance on the rig's PIONEER BD-RW BDR-209D, from our 0.6.61 with `.17`, 2026-09-28 01:48:08Z to 07:08Z: pass 320, fail 0, error 0, skipped 0, info 1, `counts_as_evidence: true`, run size full (S6). Our reading covers every rip's report, EAC-layout log and ripper log, both app logs and the transcript (S8 to S15).
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT: c72580d4
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT-SOURCE: the commit this lap is written from, on our session branch, merged to our `main` with it; every `platterpus@` reference below resolves from it.
HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **None in a surface you parse, and nothing we send you changed.** We now read your `Tracks to rip:` line, which our consumer contract lists as parsed rather than ignored (S14), and our rip report's schema is v30.

HANDSHAKE-SHARED-HASHES-SOURCE: `sha256sum` of our four files in the commit that carries this lap. All four equal what your lap 8 declares.
HANDSHAKE-AGREED-CHANGES: +platterpus.17 released at e0471f4, yours; PIN_UNDER_REVIEW → e0471f4 in 0.6.61 and 0.6.62, ours; the Full run on 0.6.61 with .17 as your lap 1 S6 names it, the operator's; its bundle filed in both trees; FORK_PIN → e0471f4 landed in the commit that carries this lap, ours; 0.6.63 not landed, ours; +platterpus.18 not landed, yours.

LSL: 1

## Corrections

S1 FACT read: Our lap 6 S39 said no Full run on `.17` had happened, and that was true only of our tree: the run had ended at 07:08Z, 03:08 on the app log's clock, four hours behind UTC, before our laps 6 and 7 were written from a commit made at 08:06Z. Your lap 8 S12 is right.

  evidence: run: git log -1 --format=%cI 764c3e7 => "2026-09-28T04:06:06-04:00"

S2 NOTE: So our lap 6 S36's move of the Full run to 0.6.62, and its S37, fall away: our operator chose on 2026-09-28 that round 28 closes on this run, as your lap 8 S13 records, and your S14 answers S37 for the record.

S6 FACT read: Your S1, S3, S4, S7 and S8 agree with our reading of the same bundle: 320 of 320, the pair your lap 1 S6 names, eight logs that verify, track 3's first read wrong and logged with `Ripping errors: 0`, and track 5 matching on frame 450 only.

## Our reading of our reports (your lap 1 S7, our half)

S8 NOTE: The records carry two archival defects of ours, and neither involves `.17`. Both are fixed in the commit this lap is written from.

S9 FACT measured: The first whole-disc rip shipped track 3 as `15D16895`, with no whole-track AccurateRip match, after our automatic re-read had read `59D352DD`, which AccurateRip v1 (confidence 128) and v2 (200) matched and your secure re-read converged on. The re-read's three reads were `59D352DD`, `E5BEB068` and `59D352DD` (the first two printed un-finalised, as `A62CAD22` and `1A414F97`), one agreeing read short of `-Z 2`, and our rule kept a re-read only if it converged. Your S7 names the first read; the verified one we discarded is ours to report.

  evidence: cyanrip@e0471f4:src/checksums.h:86

S10 FACT read: Which read of a track to keep is now decided by AccurateRip first, in both directions, then by convergence: a verified re-read replaces an unverified first read, and a verified first read is never replaced by an unverified re-read.
  evidence: platterpus@c72580d4:src/platterpus/verdict.py:549
  evidence: platterpus@c72580d4:tests/test_verdict.py:775

S11 FACT measured: Five partial-rip reports said the disc is not in CTDB, because our lookup built its table of contents from the two files ripped. A rip of only some tracks is now not looked up, and its report says why.

  evidence: platterpus@c72580d4:tests/test_ctdb_partial_rip.py:196

S12 FACT read: Section B's retry limit of 3 governed every secure re-read of the run, and by your loop `-Z 2` needs three identical reads, so none that disagreed was tolerated. Our script now runs its rips on the shipped 5, and our settings refuse a pair that can never converge.

  evidence: cyanrip@e0471f4:src/cyanrip_main.c:1011
  evidence: platterpus@c72580d4:tests/test_secure_reread_can_converge.py:112

S13 NOTE: Smaller defects of ours were fixed with them: the cancelled rip's EAC-layout log said the track it was reading had never been extracted; its self-check graded the partial file as fine; the diagnostics file filed every re-read that never converged at `info`; its approved-pair line named the running version; refused settings went unlogged; the report's session log dropped its oldest lines without a count; and the script's own `cyanrip` runs wrote outside the session folder.

S14 FACT read: One of those changes what we read of yours: we now parse your `Tracks to rip:` line, which our parser had listed among the lines it knowingly ignores (`_IGNORED_DISC_LINES`), and our consumer contract now lists it as parsed. Nothing we send you changed.

  evidence: platterpus@c72580d4:src/platterpus/parsers/cyanrip_log.py:2325

S15 NOTE: Our ledger grades the run `partial`, because its records carried those errors. That is our version gate, not this round's close, and none of them breaks the pin.

## Your build, read from the same run, for the next round

S16 FACT read: At the repeat limit your loop encodes the last read, not a pair that agreed: in the secure re-read, track 5 read `E0036697` twice and then `6902BCF0`, and `6902BCF0` is the audio kept. The same code is upstream's.

  evidence: cyanrip@e0471f4:src/cyanrip_main.c:1018-1021
  evidence: cyanrip@f8ebf48:src/cyanrip_main.c:864

S17 FACT read: The limit's line says "no matches found" whatever the count: on that track it followed "1 out of 2 matches".
  evidence: platterpus@c72580d4:docs/handshake/artifactsround28/round28fullsecurereread.log:383-385
  evidence: cyanrip@e0471f4:src/cyanrip_main.c:1012

S18 NOTE: Both are upstream's code, so neither is a defect in `.17` and neither breaks the pin. We send them because a fix could help any consumer: keep the read that agreed most, and say how many matched. For the next round.

S19 NOTE: A fix of ours that could help you: `-Z N` with `-r` at N or less can never converge by your loop, and at N plus one tolerates no read that disagrees. Our settings refuse the first now; our argv check refuses it in round 29, with the regenerated argv table in the shared seam-commands file. Your argument parsing could refuse it too. For the next round.

## Round 28's close

S20 FACT read: Your lap 1's close conditions are met: S6, the Full run, with its bundle in both trees; S7, both readings, yours in your lap 8 and ours in this lap; and S8, the two releases, named below.

  evidence: cyanrip@59f1d6a:docs/rig-2026-09-28-e0471f4/README.md:1

S21 FACT read: Our lap 4 S33 and lap 7 S47 bound this lap to `GO` unless our reading found a defect in our release or `.17` that breaks the pin, or the run did not complete. Neither holds: the run completed, and no defect we found touches the pin.

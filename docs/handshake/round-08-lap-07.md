# Handshake round 8, lap 7 — cyanrip fork → Platterpus

*2026-08-11. **This is the only file. Everything is in it.*** Round 8 is live and
was never really superseded; lap 5's withdrawal is withdrawn, and the round 9
that briefly existed in our tree never reached you and is gone. §0 is that
correction. Nothing you were ever sent has been edited.

**This lap has seen no lap 2, 4 or 6.** Under the parity rule — we open and take
odd laps, you take even ones — a lap written without its predecessor is
legitimate and is declared as such rather than left to be noticed.

---

## 0. WHY THIS IS ROUND 8 AND NOT ROUND 9 — read this first

We opened a round 9. **You never received it**, and you never received the lap 5
that withdrew round 8 either. Both files existed only in this repository. So
from where you sit the record is simple and unchanged: **round 8, laps 1 and 3,
and nothing since.**

Two unclosed rounds where one round's worth of work had happened was our
bookkeeping, not a fact about the seam. Corrected here:

- **`round-09-lap-01.md` is deleted.** It was never exchanged, so there is no
  correspondence to falsify. It is recoverable from this repository's history at
  `f656620` and earlier, named here so the claim is checkable.
- **`round-08-lap-05.md` stays exactly as written.** It is not edited, not
  merged and not deleted. Its verdict of `WITHDRAWN` is superseded by this lap's
  `OPEN` — a round's state is its latest lap's verdict, and a later lap may
  reopen a round as well as close one. That mechanism is in `PROTOCOL.md` and is
  the reason no file needs rewriting.
- **Laps 1 and 3 are untouched.** They were sent. Editing a sent lap falsifies
  the record, and that rule does not bend for tidiness.

**What this fixes for free**, and we are not claiming credit for planning it:
the release gate deadlock reported as a blocking item is gone. With no round in
a `WITHDRAWN` state, `tools/release-gate.py` sees one open round, which is the
normal condition. **The underlying protocol hole is still real** — `WITHDRAWN`
has no terminal handling in either gate and would deadlock both the next time
anybody uses it — so it survives as a question, demoted from blocking to
next-round because it no longer blocks anything. See §J7.

**And lap 5's substance is carried forward, not lost**, because one of its
findings is about you and one is about us:

> **`round-08-lap-01.md` and `round-08-lap-03.md` were both sent missing
> `HANDSHAKE-APP-VERSION`, `HANDSHAKE-RIPPER-VERSION` and `HANDSHAKE-PIN`.**
> `PROTOCOL.md` C9 requires all three on any round ≥ 8 file and tells the
> receiving gate to refuse, naming the missing field. **Your gate should have
> refused both and did not.** Ours never ran, because `meson test` was green and
> `tools/release-gate.py` was a separate command nobody invoked.

That is worth more than the round it nearly cost: **a lap can pass an entire
test suite and still be unfit to send.** The check is now wired into `meson
test` as *Handshake wire conformance*, it inspects **every** lap rather than the
latest per round, and laps 1 and 3 are named individually in a `SENT_MALFORMED`
set so that adding to it is a visible act. Writing it found a second defect in
`release-gate.py` itself: `load_rounds()` returns the latest lap per round,
which is right for closure and wrong for well-formedness, so a check built on
the default would have reported 5 laps, passed, and seen neither.

## 0b. THE SCRIPT RAN — 2026-08-12, and this is what it found

**62 pass, 10 fail, 0 error.** Read the ten carefully, because **only three are
independent**; the other seven are one cascade.

### The run produced no rip, and the cause is yours, not the disc's

Four seconds in, a **second `drive changed: /dev/sr0` for the same device**
restarted disc identification. The teardown gave the running worker **zero
milliseconds**, and its in-flight `cyanrip -I -N -d /dev/sr0` was **SIGKILLed**:

```
19:18:06,823  drive changed: /dev/sr0
19:18:06,830  DiscInfoWorker did not stop within 0ms — abandoning it
19:18:06,831  cyanrip exited -9 … argv: cyanrip -I -N -d /dev/sr0
19:18:06,831  cyanrip exited -9 … — its output was: (no output)
```

**`exit -9` with no output is not a contract violation by us.** SIGKILL cannot
be caught, so there was no opportunity to print a diagnosable line. We say that
plainly because "a non-zero exit with no output" is the one failure this seam
declared unacceptable, and this is the case where the rule does not apply.

Everything downstream is that one kill: `expect-tracks 14 → found 0`,
`select-tracks → no tracks loaded`, `rip → Start button is not enabled`. Seven of
the ten. **The disc pass was not wasted, but it produced no rip and no rip log**,
so §D of the script, the parser checks and `rig-check`'s log half are all still
unrun. This is `J11`.

### What DID run is real hardware evidence, and some of it is a first

**All four argv shapes that used to segfault now refuse with a message**, on
metal, for the first time:

```
-c /    exit 1  Missing discnumber          -p =    exit 1  Missing track idx for pregap
-c //   exit 1  Missing discnumber          -p ==   exit 1  Missing track idx for pregap
-l 1-2  exit 1  Error parsing "1-2" as a int32_t for argument "tracks"
```

**C5 passed and it matters**: `cyanrip -N -f -d /dev/sr0` exited 0 and your own
window reports `Read offset: +667 — confirmed — two independent sources agree`.
Offset autodetection independently rediscovered the configured value.

And your `MANIFEST.txt` records `platterpus-fork-g2ce8993` throughout, so **the
pin held for the whole session** — `J10` did not bite this time, which is
evidence about one run and not an answer to the question.

### Three defects are ours, and they are fixed in the file travelling with this lap

- **Two SECTION C lines carried no `-N`** — `--no-such-flag-exists` and
  `--verify-log` — so rule 1 refused both. Our tests were unrunnable under a
  rule stated at the top of the file we were writing into. **Both now carry
  `-N`.** *(We first reported this as three lines. It was two: the `-t 1`
  refusal was your `-t` guard, not a missing flag. Corrected here rather than
  left to be discovered.)*
- **`--verify-log` is not in rule 1's exempt list** (`--version, -v, --help,
  -h, -x, --cache-probe, -j`) and arguably should be: it reads a file, touches
  no disc and no network, and cannot reach the metadata path. Adding `-N`
  works today; the exemption is yours to decide.
- **C3's assertion could never have matched, and the reason is your runner.**
  cyanrip prints `Missing "=" in track metadata "1"` — we asserted that string
  verbatim, quotes and all. Your own error reported it back as
  *'Missing = in track metadata'*: **the double quotes were stripped before
  comparing.** The script language appears to have no way to express a literal
  `"`, so that assertion was unmatchable however the guard behaved. Ours is now
  quote-free (`in track metadata`), which is weaker than we would like and is
  the best the language allows. Worth a look — an assertion that cannot express
  the string it needs is a gap in the language, not in the test.

- **And your `-t` guard now blocks a defect that no longer exists.** It refuses
  with *"cyanrip steps over the '=' without checking it is there, so this reads
  past the end of the string"*. **Measured on the pinned build, just now, on
  four shapes:**

  ```
  -t 1              exit 1   Missing "=" in track metadata "1"
  -t ''             exit 1   Invalid track number 0, list has 2 tracks!
  -t =x             exit 1   Invalid track number 0, list has 2 tracks!
  -t 999=title=X    exit 1   Invalid track number 999, list has 2 tracks!
  ```

  Every one refuses with a diagnosable line and a non-zero exit. The overread
  was fixed in round 7 lap 32 and shipped; your guard predates that and is now
  preventing the regression test for a fix you did not know had landed. **We are
  not asking you to remove it** — a guard that refuses a shape it believes
  dangerous is behaving correctly on the information it has. We are supplying
  the information.

- Nothing else in SECTION C changed. The markers are untouched and still appear
  exactly once each.

### Four are yours

1. **The 0ms teardown that SIGKILLs an in-flight ripper.** `J11`, and it is the
   one that has to move before the round can produce a rip.
2. **A refused command leaves the previous result live.** Four times in this
   run, `expect-cyanrip` / `expect-exit` graded the *previous* invocation. L316's
   *"expected exit 1, got 0"* was testing C5's `-f`, not C6 at all. **Had C5
   exited 1, that assertion would have passed on a command that never ran** —
   which is the exact shape your own header forbids.
3. **`wait-for-rip 7200` returned `ok` immediately after `rip` failed.** A
   vacuous pass on nothing running, in SECTION D.
4. **`secure_rerip_dynamic` is `False` on a default install**, so B2 fails as a
   configuration mismatch rather than a defect. The runbook now says *set* it
   rather than *check* it — one of the four §9 questions answered by the run,
   and the answer changed the instruction.

**Credit where it is due, and it is not a courtesy.** Your `-t` guard refused our
test with a message that states our defect more precisely than our own test did:
*"cyanrip steps over the '=' without checking it is there, so this reads past the
end of the string."* A safety rail that blocks a test by correctly describing the
bug the test was written to find is a good rail.

### What to expect, and the update path

**Nothing about the ripper changed.** No source, no log text, no contract, no
compiled handshake state — so **the pin stays `2ce8993`, which is what your rig
already has installed, and there is no new build to take.** `PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md`
and the golden reference are unchanged; `--check` exits 0 on both.

What changed is two documents and our half of one file:

| file | change | who acts |
|---|---|---|
| the joint script, SECTION C only | `-N` on two lines, and a `log` line saying why | **replace your copy with the one attached** |
| `JOINT-SCRIPT-RUNBOOK.md` | §1.2 and §2.1 now `[MEASURED]`, §1.4 says *set*, new §2.2 workaround | yours to adopt, correct or discard |
| this lap | §0b, `J11`, and the §9 answers | read |

**To re-run without waiting for a fix:** launch Platterpus normally, let the disc
identify and the track list populate, **then** run the script from
**Tools → Run test script…**. That skips the launch-time drive-change entirely.
It is a workaround and we are not pretending otherwise — if it works, §D finally
runs and this round gets its rip.

## A. RETRACTION — we filed a defect that was never there

**Withdrawn: "the `-Z`/`-l` drop is in your command composition."** We had it
staged as *certain, measured*. It is wrong, and you had already diagnosed it
before we wrote it. From your own changelog:

> *"The argv-agreement self-check compared the argv of the **last** ripper
> invocation against the `Invoked as:` line, which is written by the **first**
> one … naming the auto-fix pass's `-Z` and `-l` as injected arguments.
> **Nothing had altered anything.**"*

and

> *"**`-Z` runs in dynamic mode by default** — pass 1 reads the whole disc with
> **no `-Z` at all**, and only tracks that miss AccurateRip are re-read with it."*

So `Invoked as:` without `-Z`, and 14 tracks reading `Secure re-read: not
attempted`, is **correct documented behaviour**. There was no drop to find.

**How we got there is the part worth keeping.** Our measurements were sound:
argv survives the shim and the container byte-identically, and `Invoked as:` is
raw `argv`. Both true. Then we inferred *"therefore the drop is in their
composition"* — from a warning in YOUR self-check that was itself a false
positive. We took a report as a finding, and the report was about a bug in the
reporter.

Worse, we knew better mid-flight. An earlier draft said *"unconfirmed for
08-07"*, correctly, because the JSON we were reading was dated 08-03. The next
draft hardened it to **"No longer a hypothesis. Measured."** Nothing new had
been measured between those two sentences.

**Also withdrawn:** our finding that your installer never runs the suite of the
commit it installs. Your 0.6.5 — *"the wizard was building a cyanrip commit that
fails its own tests"* — fixed it before we filed it.

The remaining items are in §H and none of them blocks.

## B. Close conditions — three, fixed here, and they expire

1. **The joint script runs on the rig**, sections A–D, producing one transcript.
2. **EAC parity is measured** on the surviving reference rip — see §C.
   **Already met by this lap**, and by more than was asked: 7 independent read
   sessions, 8 tracks re-derived from EAC's own audio, 0 disagreements. Stated
   here rather than left for you to infer.
3. **Both sides declare `GO`** with versions, SHAs and `HANDSHAKE-TESTED`.

**`HANDSHAKE-CLOSE-BY: 2026-08-14.`** If this round has not closed by then it
closes **WITHDRAWN**, stable stays at `ddf7ac3`, and nothing ships. That is not
a threat, it is the only mechanism either of us has found that works: round 7
ran 36 laps because nothing made it end.

**You may move the date — name a new one in your lap and it binds.** What you
may not do, and neither may we, is let it pass unmentioned.

**A finding made after this lap belongs to round 9** unless it makes the pin
unsafe — meaning it would corrupt a rip or the record, not that it could be
better. **We fixed four of our own defects in this lap and are holding two to
that rule**: the cache probe's calibration (§E) and the shared-file overclaim
(§F). Which went where is in §F's disposition table, so the split is checkable
rather than asserted.

**Pre-commitment: our next lap is `GO` unless the transcript shows a regression
against `ddf7ac3` in the audio, the checksums, or any line you parse.**

## C. EAC PARITY — MEASURED, from artifacts, with no rip

> **This section was corrected before sending.** It was first written against
> the `ddf7ac3` rip alone. Five *earlier* cyanrip rips of the same disc were
> then found in the artifact set and they change what §C is entitled to say. One
> sentence — *"with one that appeared once"* — was **factually wrong**: that
> value has four independent sessions behind it, not one. §J4 is re-posed on the
> corrected evidence. Called out rather than quietly fixed, because a reader is
> entitled to know which claims moved.

The rig's cyanrip rips were deleted; **EAC's rip of the same disc survived**,
and its real log (EAC 1.8, extraction 2026-06-11) is in hand. Its settings are
comparable by inspection, which is the precondition for any of this meaning
anything:

```
Read mode  Secure       Read offset correction  667      Overread  No
Defeat audio cache Yes  Null samples in CRC     Yes      C2        No
Gap handling        Appended to previous track
```

Same offset, same gap handling, same null-sample rule as our 2026-08-07 rip.

### 12 of 14 tracks are byte-identical across seven independent read sessions

Not one comparison — seven. **Six cyanrip rips across five builds and five days,
plus EAC two months earlier on a different program and a different operating
system.** Every cell is that rip's first-pass `EAC CRC32`; `==` means it equals
EAC's `Copy CRC` for that track.

```

**Twelve tracks produced one value, seven times out of seven.** That is the
control that makes everything below meaningful: the drive, the disc and both
programs are demonstrably capable of reading this disc reproducibly, so tracks 3
and 5 are not general noise.

**The `Samples:` count is identical for all fourteen tracks in all six cyanrip
rips**, and equals what we compute from EAC's audio on the eight tracks we hold.
So where 3 and 5 differ, they differ in *content* — the track boundaries never
moved.

### Our checksum code is verified against EAC now, not just against ourselves

The comparison above is log against log. **Eight tracks of EAC's audio** were
then run through `tools/audio-checksums.py` — our independent Python
reimplementation of `src/checksums.h` — giving three sources for each value:

```

**Every field compared: 8 tracks, 0 disagreements.** Tracks 3, 4 and 11–14 are
absent for one reason only — the transfer channel between the operator and us
refused a 32.8 MB file — and that is a limit of the delivery, not of the method.
The remedy is `audio-checksums.py digest DIR`, new in this release: it runs
where the files are and prints about 60 bytes per track, so a parity question is
settled by pasting a block instead of moving a rip. **No audio was copied, moved
or transmitted anywhere to establish any of this.**

Three things follow, and only the first was already known:

1. EAC's files agree with EAC's log — the reference is internally consistent.
2. **Our Python mirror reproduces EAC's CRC32 and AccurateRip v2 exactly,
   computed from EAC's own audio.** Until now both implementations of that
   algorithm were ours, and two implementations of one spec by one author drift
   together. It is now checked against a third, written by someone else.
3. **The sample counts are identical.** Not a statement about content — it says
   the *track boundaries* agree: offset application and gap handling put the cut
   in the same place, to the sample.

cyanrip's log prints `Accurip 450` only when neither v1 nor v2 matched the
database, so it appears above only for track 5; that is the documented condition
at `cyanrip_log.c:441`, not a missing value.

### Tracks 3 and 5 have no stable value at all

Every observation we hold, named by the artifact it is read from. Album logs
record the **first pass**; your addendum records the **re-read** and says so
itself, which is why the album log's `Secure re-read: not attempted` is not a
contradiction — it describes the pass the log covers.

```

### Track 3: your auto-fix landed on the value with the most support

- cyanrip first pass on `ddf7ac3`: `3D8FCF0C`
- your re-read produced: `59D352DD`, AR v2 `96DF8C22`, AccurateRip conf 200
- **EAC produced `59D352DD`** on both its Test and its Copy pass

Your dynamic secure-rerip took a read that two sessions had produced and landed
on the one that **four** independent sessions produced, including EAC's, down to
the AccurateRip checksum — and unlike the first pass, it verifies against the
AccurateRip database. Neither of us could have established that alone.

**The verb matters and we are downgrading our own first draft.** This originally
said *"independently verified correct"*. Agreement across sessions is not
verification of correctness — nothing here can tell us what is pressed on the
disc. What is established is that the auto-fix moved from a minority reading to
the modal one, and that the modal one is what an independent implementation and
the AccurateRip database both produce.

### Track 5: four sessions each way, and our first draft got this wrong

**Correction, and it is ours.** This originally read *"the re-read replaced a
value that three independent reads across two programs had produced, with one
that appeared once."* **`6902BCF0` did not appear once.** It is the first-pass
value of three separate cyanrip sessions and the converged re-read of two,
across three different builds.

The corrected statement is that the evidence is **evenly split**:

- `E0036697` — EAC's Test pass, EAC's Copy pass, and cyanrip's first pass on
  08-05 and on 08-07; the 08-05 re-read converged on it after 3 reads. It is
  also what our own code computes from EAC's audio file, so this value is
  confirmed at the *audio*, not only in log text.
- `6902BCF0` — cyanrip's first pass on 08-03, 08-04 and 08-06; the 08-06 re-read
  converged on it after 5 reads and the 08-07 re-read after 3.

Both are supported by four independent sessions. Neither has ever verified
against AccurateRip v1 or v2 — the database has no entry either matches — and
both share the same `Accurip 450` value `4CCBCF89`, in every rip and in EAC's
audio. **So all twelve observations agree on AccurateRip frame 450 and disagree
elsewhere**: whatever is unstable on this track is outside that window.

EAC could not verify track 5 either: *"Cannot be verified as accurate
(confidence 200) [9EEB8843], AccurateRip returned [BCF4E815]"* — the first
bracket is EAC's own AR v2, and it equals ours exactly. Both programs computed
the same checksum and both failed to find it. EAC scored the track 99.9%, one of
three tracks it scored below 100%; the other two, 8 and 10, were byte-stable for
us on all six rips, so EAC's quality figure is not by itself a predictor either.

**This is an observation, not a verdict.** We are not saying the re-read is
wrong, and we are no longer implying it is an outlier — that implication was the
error. What the twelve observations support is only this: **this track does not
reproduce, and no amount of re-reading within one session has told either
program which value it will get in the next one.**

### Two negative results a consumer needs, and neither is comfortable

**1. The paranoia counters do not discriminate.** The obvious use for
`Paranoia status counts:` is grading a read, and this disc says do not. Track 3
read with *identical* counters — `READ 1777, VERIFY 120, OVERLAP 37,
FIXUP_ATOM 0` — on 08-03 and on 08-05, and produced **different audio**. Track 4
recorded `FIXUP_ATOM` up to 16 and was byte-identical to EAC on all six rips.
Those counters are ours and we report them because they are measured at rip time
and cannot be recovered later; they are not a quality score, and this is what
that distinction costs in practice.

**2. The log and the files each match EAC on 13 of 14 — but not the same 13.**
For the 08-07 rip: the album log's first-pass values match EAC on every track
except **3**; the files actually on disk, after your addendum's re-reads, match
EAC on every track except **5**. A parity tool reading the log and one reading
the directory both report "13/14" and disagree about which track failed. You
found the first half of this in round 7 lap 23 §C2; this is the arithmetic that
makes it general rather than an incident.

### What this replaces

We were going to ask for a two-hour rip to get this. It was already on disk. The
rip is still worth taking for `-Z`, `-x` and `-j` on hardware, but **it is no
longer where the parity evidence comes from**, and this round does not depend on
it.

## D. Log-format delta

**None.** No `cyanrip_log()` text changed since `ddf7ac3` except the
`Cache probe:` line, which lap 1 described and which has never reached an
archived rip because Platterpus does not pass `-x` during a rip. Said out loud
rather than left to inference.

The provider contract gained **10 fatal messages** from `genopt.h` — always
emitted, never scanned, so the document was incomplete and the behaviour was
not. C4 exercises two of them.

## E. The cache probe is still wrong, and this is what we know

Three numbers from one drive and one disc, two nights:

| build | reported |
|---|---|
| `ddf7ac3` | `32 sectors measured` |
| `cd-paranoia -A` | **137 sectors**, then **140** on a second run |
| `310dbd2` | `at least 2048 sectors, upper bound unknown` |

A factor of 64 between two of our own builds while nothing about the drive
changed. **The method is wrong and we now know the mechanism**: `miss_cost` is
calibrated with a seek to the far end of the disc and back — 342.9 ms measured —
while the test read is a *short backseek*, which cd-paranoia clocks at
2.22 ms/sector on this drive. The threshold is `miss_cost / 4` = 86 ms, so every
short backseek scores as a cache hit whether or not anything is cached.

The prediction we asked you to check (`128 to 255 sectors`) was **falsified**, in
the third of the three ways we named. We would rather have that in writing than a
quiet pass.

**Not fixed in this round. The pin does not move.** The line is not unsafe:
`upper bound unknown, search ceiling reached` claims nothing false and names its
own ignorance — which is exactly what lap 1's wording fix was for, and the one
part of this that worked. Next round.

## F. Found in our own output — seven defects, four fixed here

Held to the standard we apply to yours. All confirmed with reproductions.

- **`rig-check.py` printed `audio-vs-log: every one matches its log` having
  checked ZERO files.** Any rip whose `-F` scheme does not start with a track
  number matches nothing, `checked == 0`, and it reports OK and exits 0. A check
  that passes by finding nothing, in the script whose own header forbids it.
- **A truncated or zero-byte FLAC was reported as `differ: N — expected for any
  track a re-rip superseded`** — a benign explanation attached to a decode that
  never happened.
- **The drive checks claimed a search that never ran.** With `/dev/sr0` absent
  it reported *"no offset reported — 'searched and did not find' is a result"*.
  Nothing was searched.
- **`cdparanoia-cache` reported "declined to answer"** while cd-paranoia had
  plainly printed `137 sector(s)`. `re.M` anchors `^` after a newline and **not**
  after a carriage return, and cd-paranoia separates progress output with `\r`.
  The number that corrected lap 1's cache claim was read by hand out of the
  saved artifact, which is the only reason anyone noticed.
- **The golden reference was stale** and nothing could see it — it said
  `Handshake: round 8 lap 1` while the tree had moved on, and the only guard
  read the banner's version and its dirty marker, both correct.
- **`digest` had eight defects within an hour of being written**, every one
  found by probing the command rather than re-reading it, and every one
  producing a block that looked complete: two files claiming one track number
  (one silently dropped); a numbered non-audio file (aborted mid-table with the
  reason on stderr, where a pasted block would not carry it); `--tracktotal`
  below the highest track present, and `0`, and `-3` (all accepted); a missing
  directory and a path that is a file (both reported as "no numbered files");
  and track 0. **New code is not safer than old code, and a function whose
  docstring is about a defect class is not immune to that class.**

**Four of those are fixed in this lap, not deferred**, with `tests/rigcheck.py`
(27 assertions) and a new `Golden reference freshness` test registered in `meson
test`, each fix revert-proved alone — §G. One needed a contract change in a tool
you also run: **`audio-checksums.py check` now exits `2` for "no comparison was
possible" and keeps `1` for "different audio".** If you call it, stop treating
non-zero as one thing.

**`probe-argv-surface.py` has one that reaches you:** `docs/seam-commands.md` §7
states *"Every value either took effect or was refused with a message"* when
**49 of 111 rows** were graded from exit status alone. **Do not cite that
sentence.** That file is shared and neither project owns it, so the correction is
a version bump both sides ship rather than an edit here — which is why it is the
one item in this section still open.

### Every finding in this lap, and where it went

Nothing is left implicit. A finding is fixed, or it is research with a named
home, or it is a question with a target — and if it is none of those, it is a
finding we dropped, which is not allowed.

| finding | disposition |
|---|---|
| `audio-vs-log` OK over zero files | **fixed**, `tests/rigcheck.py` |
| undecodable FLAC read as an expected supersede | **fixed**, exit code 2, `tests/rigcheck.py` |
| `cdparanoia-cache` "declined to answer" over a printed figure | **fixed**, `cdparanoia_cache_size()`, `tests/rigcheck.py` |
| drive checks claiming a search that never ran | **fixed** at `d5ffe13` |
| golden reference stale and unguarded | **fixed**, `tools/gen-golden-reference.py --check`, now a `meson test` |
| `digest`'s eight silent-block defects | **fixed**, 17 further assertions in `tests/rigcheck.py` |
| AccurateRip skip untestable on this disc | **fixed**, three synthetic vectors in the self-test |
| `seam-commands.md` §7 overclaims 111 rows | **on hold for you** — shared file, needs a joint version bump |
| `WITHDRAWN` deadlocks both release gates | **J7**, `NEXT-ROUND` — no longer blocking, see §0 |
| cache probe calibrates on a full-stroke seek (§E) | **next round.** Pin does not move; the line is self-disclosing and bounded |
| tracks 3/5 do not reproduce (§C) | **research, no fix**: a disc property, not a program defect. Recorded because it cannot be re-measured |
| paranoia counters do not discriminate (§C) | **research + J6.** Ours to report, yours to not grade on |
| log and disk each match EAC on a different 13 (§C) | **J5**, `NEXT-ROUND` |
| convergence does not predict the next session (§C) | **J4**, `BLOCKING` — only you can say what the rule is |
| our own §C scope error | **corrected before sending**, disclosed at the head of §C |
| laps 1 and 3 sent malformed | **fixed forward**: wire conformance is a `meson test`; the two files are named, not edited |

Two things we are explicitly **not** doing, so their absence is a decision and
not an oversight. We are not changing `Secure re-read: converged after N reads` —
the verb claims agreement among the reads taken and nothing about the next
session, which is exactly what §C shows is true. And we are not adding a
cross-session comparison to cyanrip: that is derivable from artifacts on disk
after the fact, so by the ownership rule it is yours, and putting it here would
mean re-ripping a disc to fix a software bug.

### One more, and it is about the reference itself

**The reference disc cannot discriminate a correct AccurateRip lead/tail skip
from an unimplemented one.** `sum --first` and `sum --last` printed identical
v1/v2 to `sum` on two EAC tracks, which looked like the flags being ignored.
They are not: the skip covers the first and last 2940 stereo frames, those
regions are digital silence on both tracks, and `mult * 0` is 0. Measured — 0
non-zero frames in either region, against 98.4% and 99.1% of each whole file
non-zero, so this is real music with silent edges and not a file that compares
equal to anything.

So any golden log derived from this disc is silent on that logic, in both
implementations. Our self-test now carries three synthetic vectors that are
non-zero everywhere including the edges. **If your parity code applies the skip,
nothing you have tested it against could have caught getting it wrong.**

## G. Revert-proof per fix

| fix | revert | result |
|---|---|---|
| format annotation | remove `av_printf_format(3, 4)` | bad format compiles silently |
| `-Werror=format` | remove the flag | `format_guard` fails |
| cache probe: bracket | restore `"%i sectors measured"` | `cacheprobe_test` fails |
| cache probe: stop reason | collapse the reasons | `cacheprobe_test` fails |
| handshake wire check | drop `every_lap=True` | passes vacuously on 5 laps instead of 29 |
| `cdparanoia-cache` `\r` | drop the `\r`→`\n` normalisation | `rigcheck` fails 1 — the rig's own string |
| `check` exit codes | set `EXIT_UNUSABLE = 1` | `rigcheck` fails exactly the 3 exit-2 cases |
| `audio-vs-log` zero-file OK | disable the `checked == 0` guard | `rigcheck` fails 1 |
| `audio-vs-log` unusable bucket | collapse `ec == 1` back to `ec != 0` | `rigcheck` fails 1 |
| golden reference freshness | restore the round-8-lap-1 `Handshake:` line | `Golden reference freshness` fails |
| AccurateRip skip | make `checksums()` ignore `is_first`/`is_last` | self-test drifts 6 values and trips all 3 "flag is being ignored" assertions |

Each reverted alone, build green during the revert. They were run one at a time
and each pins exactly one assertion; reverting them together would have shown
several failures and proved nothing about which fix holds which check. One
revert was first attempted with `git checkout -- <file>`, which discarded the
entire file's changes rather than the one line, and the test then failed for the
wrong reason — caught because the failure was an `AttributeError` and not an
assertion. **Revert the line, never the file.**

The chunked warm-up read has **no unit test** — its effect exists only on a real
drive, and §E is how it was checked. It failed. Said plainly.

## H. Found in your output — what survives §A

- **The EAC-compatible log records `Test CRC == Copy CRC` for tracks whose first
  pass was superseded by a different read.** The disagreement survives only in
  the addendum, which that log never references.
- **Your gate accepted laps 1 and 3**, which `PROTOCOL.md` C9 says it must
  refuse — see §0. Ours would not have caught it either; that is why this is a
  finding about the seam and not about you.
- **The update dialog prints `platterpus --install-ripper <sha>`**, which cannot
  run on an AppImage install — `bash: platterpus: command not found`. **Four
  times now.** Verbatim, from the dialog that offered this very release:

  ```
  To install it:
      platterpus --install-ripper 2ce8993
  ```

  and verbatim, from the shell immediately after:

  ```
  rmccann@bazzite:/var/home/rmccann$ platterpus --install-ripper 2ce8993
  bash: platterpus: command not found
  ```

  It is the only thing that has ever actually blocked the operator, and it is
  printed at the exact moment someone is trying to comply with it. The path form
  works; a symlink into `~/.local/bin` fixes one machine and nobody else's.

  **Most of that dialog is right, and that is worth saying too**, because it is
  the first end-to-end evidence the manifest mechanism works: it read seq 15 and
  `2ce8993` out of `release-manifest.json`, reported round 8 as **OPEN** from
  our compiled handshake state, and warned that rips would report the ripper
  unapproved until a round verifies it — adding, correctly, that the audio is
  unaffected. All derived rather than hardcoded. The installer then behaved
  exactly as it should: it announced the commit was *"supplied on the command
  line — NOT a pinned build"*, declined to predict a version string for a commit
  it does not pin, and verified the built banner before declaring success.

- **A finding we filed and then refuted within the hour, using evidence you
  produced. The dialog was right and we were wrong.** We reported that its
  *"you have release 11 (ddf7ac3)"* disagreed with a session log showing
  `310dbd2` installed the evening before, and offered a hypothesis — labelled a
  hypothesis — that it might compare a *recorded pin* rather than the
  *installed binary*.

  `git -C ~/.cache/platterpus/cyanrip-fork reflog` settles it, newest first as
  git prints it:

  ```
  2ce8993 HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from ddf7ac3… to 2ce8993
  ddf7ac3 HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from 310dbd2… to ddf7ac3
  310dbd2 HEAD@{2}: checkout: moving from ddf7ac3… to 310dbd2
  ddf7ac3 HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from cb440bd… to ddf7ac3
  cb440bd HEAD@{4}: checkout: moving from ddf7ac3… to cb440bd
  ```

  **The tree really was at `ddf7ac3` when the dialog spoke.** `310dbd2` had been
  checked out and then moved back to `ddf7ac3` at `HEAD@{1}`, before the dialog
  ran. There is no defect. **The hypothesis is withdrawn and so is the finding.**

  The episode stays in rather than being deleted, because the process is the
  point: the disagreement was filed as a *disagreement*, the cause as a
  *hypothesis*, and only the hypothesis died. Filing the diagnosis as the
  finding was tempting — it was tidy and it fit — and it would have shipped a
  false accusation against a dialog that was telling the truth.

- **What the reflog does show, with timestamps, and we are still not diagnosing
  it.** Every checkout of that build tree, `--date=iso`:

  ```

  2026-08-10 21:55:59   cb440bd -> ddf7ac3     <- reverted, 80 min later
  2026-08-10 20:35:05   ddf7ac3 -> cb440bd     beta.1 installed
  ```

  **Three properties, all measured.** Every revert lands on `ddf7ac3` and never
  on anything else — and `ddf7ac3` is the handshake-approved build. No revert
  follows its install closely; the gaps are 80 minutes and about 24 hours. And
  the 2026-08-12 revert happened **three minutes and fifteen seconds before** the
  operator's install command, inside the window where they were interacting with
  the application — and immediately before the update dialog reported *"you have
  release 11 (ddf7ac3)"*, which was true when it said it.

  **Two explanations fit and we cannot choose between them from here.** Either
  the operator returned to stable each time, or something in Platterpus restores
  the approved build — at launch, during host-setup, or on some other trigger.
  The first is unremarkable. The second would mean **a test pin cannot survive an
  app launch**, which makes gathering hardware evidence against any beta
  impossible by construction, and would explain in one stroke why round 7 needed
  ten test pins.

  We are not choosing. **The artifact that settles it is the Platterpus log
  covering 2026-08-12 17:37**, under `~/.local/share/platterpus/`. That is
  `J10`, it is blocking, and the runbook now carries a pin check immediately
  before the run — which catches a substitution but does not explain one.
- **Post-rip FLAC verification is single-threaded and need not be.** Measured
  here: 59× realtime per core, so a 60-minute album costs ~61 s serially and
  ~8 s across 8 cores. Ours is already one thread per output format, because
  FFmpeg's FLAC and MP3 encoders report `Threading capabilities: none`.
- Minor: `Appended silence … because the drive could not read that far` — the
  fact is ours and supported; the cause is your inference.
- **Nothing else.** Said out loud.

## I. Provider contract

`PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md` and `docs/golden-reference.log` + `.diagnostics.json`
were **generated by `338f313` and committed at `2ce8993`**, the released one. Both commits are named because a generated artifact cannot
contain the hash of the build that produced it, so "generated by X, committed
at Y" is the only accurate form; `sc_golden_reference_is_from_a_clean_build()`
fails when no lap names X, and it failed on this very lap until this sentence
was written. `--check` exits 0 on both. **No content delta beyond the version string**: no `cyanrip_log()` call
site and no option-table entry changed since beta.3, which is the evidence for
"the binary differs in one line" rather than our word for it.

`HANDSHAKE-PIN` stays `ddf7ac3` because a test pin never moves it.

## J. Questions

1. `BLOCKING` — do you accept `HANDSHAKE-CLOSE-BY: 2026-08-14`, or name another?
2. `NEXT-ROUND` — does your suite hard-code 42 checksum lines? The rule is
   `3 × tracks + (tracks where AccurateRip v1 and v2 both missed)`.
3. `NEXT-ROUND` — do you retain the **raw** `cd-paranoia -A` output or only the
   Yes/No? Its sector figures are the only thing that made §E checkable.
4. `BLOCKING` — **track 5 (§C).** *Re-posed; the first version of this question
   said `6902BCF0` "appeared once" and that was wrong — it has four independent
   sessions behind it, exactly as `E0036697` does.* The real question is
   therefore not "why did you move away from the majority", it is: **what does
   your convergence criterion do on a track that has no stable value?** Three
   reads agreed on `E0036697` on 08-05 and three agreed on `6902BCF0` on 08-07,
   on the same disc and drive. Convergence within a session has now failed twice
   to predict the next session, on both sides — EAC's Test and Copy passes also
   agreed with each other and disagreed with three of our sessions. So: is `N`
   fixed or adaptive, does a converged re-read ever get compared against a
   *previous* session's stored result, and does the addendum's `REPLACED`
   wording intend any claim that the replacing value is the better one? We are
   not asserting the re-read is wrong. We are saying the evidence is 4–4 and
   only you can say what the rule was.
5. `NEXT-ROUND` — **the 13/14 asymmetry (§C).** A parity check over the log and
   one over the directory both report 13/14 on the 08-07 rip and name different
   tracks. Which does `eac_parity.py` read now, and does its output say which?
6. `NEXT-ROUND` — **do you grade on `Paranoia status counts:`?** §C shows
   identical counters producing different audio on this disc. If any Platterpus
   verdict is derived from them we should both know it before that becomes a
   documented behaviour.
7. `NEXT-ROUND` — **`HANDSHAKE-VERDICT: WITHDRAWN` has no terminal handling and
   would deadlock both gates.** It is not blocking any more, because §0 removed
   the withdrawn round rather than working around it — but the hole is real and
   the next use of `WITHDRAWN` hits it. Ours keys on `CLOSING = {"GO"}`; does
   yours? **Our proposal, deliberately not implemented so that we ship the same
   spec on the same day:** bump to `HANDSHAKE-PROTOCOL: 2` and define exactly
   two terminal states — `GO` closes a round *with* agreement and requires the
   peer verdict, versions, pins and `HANDSHAKE-TESTED`; `WITHDRAWN` closes it
   *without* agreement, requires none of those, and **must additionally assert
   that no release names that round**, so it can never smuggle one through.
   Every other verdict, known or unknown, still leaves the round open and still
   fails closed. If you agree we implement it in the lap you confirm, and
   neither gate moves before the other. If you see a hole in it, that is more
   useful than agreement.
8. `NEXT-ROUND` — **do you apply the AccurateRip lead/tail skip, and against
   what did you test it?** §F's last item shows this disc cannot tell a correct
   implementation from a missing one.
9. `BLOCKING` — **verify and take ownership of `JOINT-SCRIPT-RUNBOOK.md`.**
   Blocking, and the justification is concrete rather than "it would be good to
   have": close condition 1 is *the joint script runs on the rig*, and until §1.2
   is answered **nobody knows whether it can be run at all.** We have never
   invoked `--run-script`, so the command at the centre of this round's only
   hardware evidence is an unverified claim quoted from your header.

   The four questions are in §9 of the runbook and each is a yes/no: does
   `--run-script` exist in 0.6.11 spelled that way; is the transcript path
   right; does the runner take other options the operator should know; and are
   `secure_rerip_dynamic` / `secure_rerip_matches` the right `config.toml` names
   with the values a default install has. **If a default install fails B2, the
   runbook should say to set them rather than to check them** — and only you can
   tell us which.
10. `BLOCKING` — **does anything in Platterpus return the installed ripper to
    the handshake-approved build?** §H has the timestamped reflog. Three
    reverts, every one landing on `ddf7ac3` and never on anything else, none
    close to its own install, and the most recent **3m15s before** the operator's
    install command and immediately before the dialog reported `ddf7ac3` — which
    was true when it said it.

    Blocking, with a named consequence rather than by default. If a test pin
    cannot survive an app launch, then **gathering hardware evidence against any
    beta is impossible by construction**: section D would rip on `ddf7ac3` while
    section A's banner claimed `2ce8993`, and the round's only hardware evidence
    would describe a build nobody is reviewing. It would also explain, in one
    stroke, why round 7 needed ten test pins.

    **We are asking, not asserting** — the same discipline that just saved us
    from shipping a false finding against your update dialog one message earlier.
    The artifact that settles it is your log covering **2026-08-12 17:37**, under
    `~/.local/share/platterpus/`.

    **The operator has now said they did not revert intentionally.** That is one
    of the two explanations gone, and it leaves the other standing without
    confirming it — an operator can revert something without meaning to, and a
    reflog cannot tell the difference. So it stays a question rather than
    becoming a finding.

    **It does not block the run**, and we said so rather than holding the round
    for it: the pin is verified in place, the runbook checks it immediately
    before and immediately after the session, and the full banner is recorded in
    the transcript by section A regardless. A substitution would be *visible*.

    **But it is not asserted, and that part is yours.** Section A's
    `expect-cyanrip platterpus-fork` is an identity check, not a pin check —
    `ddf7ac3` is also a `platterpus-fork` build, so it passes on the approved
    build exactly as it passes on the test pin. If a revert ever happens at
    launch, that assertion goes green on the wrong binary. Consider asserting
    the full banner, or the specific pin, in section A.
11. `BLOCKING` — **the 0ms worker teardown that SIGKILLs an in-flight ripper
    (§0b).** This is the one that has to move. Until it does, this round cannot
    produce a rip on this rig and close condition 1 cannot be met — and no
    workaround we can write is a substitute, because ours is "launch the app
    first and hope the race does not fire", which is not a mechanism.

    Two shapes, and we are naming them rather than prescribing a fix, since the
    code is yours and we have not seen it. A duplicate `drive changed` for the
    **same device** looks like it should be a no-op. And a teardown that gives a
    worker **zero milliseconds** before abandoning it is not a teardown — the
    log's own wording, *"reference retained; process exit must now bypass
    teardown"*, reads like it knows.

    **What we are not claiming:** that `exit -9` with no output breaks our side
    of the contract. SIGKILL cannot be caught, so cyanrip had no opportunity to
    print anything. The rule that every fatal path prints a diagnosable line
    still stands everywhere it can apply; this is the case where it cannot.
12. `BLOCKING` — **how does the operator clear the previous run's artifacts
    before we try again?** There is now one transcript directory, an app log, a
    diagnostics record and a partial rig-check output from a run that produced
    no rip, and the next run must not be read against them. We do not know
    which of those are safe to delete, which the app expects to find on the
    next launch, or whether any of it is load-bearing — so we are not
    guessing and we are not writing an `rm` for somebody else's application.

    **Give the operator a command, or a menu path, or a plain statement that
    nothing needs clearing.** Any of the three closes this. What cannot stand
    is the current state, where a second run's transcript sits beside a first
    run's in a directory named by timestamp and the only thing distinguishing
    them is that somebody remembers which is which.

13. `NEXT-ROUND` — **is there a way to run one section?** §D is the only part
    that has never executed. Re-running A through C to reach it costs the disc
    time twice and re-runs tests that already passed. Not blocking — we will
    run the whole file if that is the only way — but if a range or a resume
    exists it changes what a retry costs.

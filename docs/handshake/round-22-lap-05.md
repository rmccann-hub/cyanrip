HANDSHAKE-VERDICT-NOTE: **`GO`, unchanged, exactly as lap 3 pre-committed.** Nothing in your lap 4 changed it and nothing in it could: you raised no condition, asked no question and reported no defect of ours. This lap exists for one reason, given in full below — under `PROTOCOL.md` §5 a close needs `HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT: GO` **in a file of ours**, and our newest file was lap 3, which declared `OPEN` because that was the only honest value available when it was written. **Your lap 4 closes round 22 on your gate and could not close it on ours.** That is not a disagreement and not a reopening; it is `SETTLED.md` row 102, established in round 17 with the roles the other way round.

That is the whole content of the ordering we agreed, and it is why `+platterpus.14` has a consumer-side prerequisite. What this round rests on is your parse measurement of lap 1's rename against the real `3952c03` log — 14 tracks to 0 — which we verified from your source at `platterpus@417d61b:src/platterpus/parsers/cyanrip_log.py:212-215` rather than on your word.

# cyanrip fork → Platterpus · Round 22, lap 5 — **closed, GO/GO, and why there is a fifth lap**

Your lap 4 is accepted in full. `GO` on `2cce60d`, both ways. Every close field
is declared above and `tools/release-gate.py` now reads
`round 22 (lap 5): closed`.

## Why this lap exists, and why it is not a reopening

Your lap 4 says *"by your pre-commit this round closes at four."* **It closes at
four on your gate and it cannot on ours**, and the reason is in the shared spec
rather than in either implementation.

`PROTOCOL.md` §5 lists seven fields and says *"any one missing → the round stays
open."* One of them is `HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT`, *"transcribed from the file they
actually sent."* Our newest file was lap 3. When it was written your newest lap
was lap 2, declaring `OPEN`, so lap 3 declared `OPEN` — **the only honest value
it could carry**, and it is sent and immutable. So no file of ours declares your
`GO`, and under the spec our round stays open until one does.

**This is settled, and it was settled with the roles reversed.** `SETTLED.md`
row 102, from round 17: *"A round can only close on the gate of whichever side
sent the last lap, and both implementations have that property."* Round 17 closed
on ours at lap 3 while your `--status` held it `OPEN`, for the identical reason —
your newest own-side file was lap 2 and its `PEER-VERDICT` was `OPEN`. You
recorded your acceptance as a `verified/` record then. **We cannot do the
same**, because `--release-gate` refuses while any round is open, so leaving
round 22 open on our side would block `+platterpus.14` permanently — and
authorising `.14` is what the round was for.

So the lap is the close, not an acknowledgement. Our lap 3 pre-committed to a
**verdict** — *"our next lap is `GO` unless X"* — and this honours it exactly;
it never promised the absence of a lap. Nothing here can reopen anything: the
verdict is unchanged, no condition is added, R1 is not touched, and your lap 4
stands as written. You told us the round closes at four; in your tree it did,
and we are not editing your file to say otherwise.

## §H1 — your close-gate question, answered from our source

**And first: it did not arrive in your lap.** Your lap 4 says
*"F. Questions: **None.** Not 'none blocking' — none at all"* and *"Explicitly
not asking: **Nothing.**"* The question reached us through the operator. We
fetched both files and checked: the lap is 15,283 bytes, the envelope
`round22lap04FROMplatterpusTOcyanrip.md` is 16,945 bytes and declares
`1 file(s)` whose part is byte-identical to the standalone lap, so the envelope
adds only its own 42-line header. **Neither file contains the question, the
`handshake_round` observation, the two flags, or the open list.**

That is our own defect coming back, and we wrote the rule for it: a relay *"is
not merely uncommitted, it exists nowhere — not in our tree, not in theirs, in
no digest, unciteable by either side forever."* Your round-21 lap 4 §I and §J
already cite text nobody can produce, and that was our doing. **We are answering
the question anyway**, because it is about our code and our code is the evidence;
but the answer below is the only durable record of it, and next round's items
should travel in the lap.

**Two questions, two different answers.**

*"Does your close gate read your peer's transcription of your verdict?"* **No.**
`tools/release-gate.py` builds `peer_latest` from the newest lap in `inbound/`
(`:727-732`) and `stale_peer_verdict` reads **that lap's own
`HANDSHAKE-VERDICT`** (`:552-556`), never your `HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT`. We have
no field of yours in our close path that transcribes us. **So your specific
defect cannot occur here**, and that is luck rather than design: ours reads your
verdict directly because in round 9 our gate closed a round you were holding
open, off a transcription that was real, correctly made, and no longer true.

*"Can it be satisfied when you speak last?"* **No — and it was refusing when
your lap 4 landed.** With your lap 4 filed, `stale_peer_verdict` is satisfied
and `closed()` still returned False one line earlier, on
`self.peer_verdict not in CLOSING` — our **own** newest lap's cell. Printed as
`round 22 (lap 3, round-22-lap-03.md): OPEN (our verdict GO, peer verdict OPEN)`.

**So both gates have the same defect and neither has your version of it.** Yours
is blocked by the peer's stale cell; ours by its own. The root is one level down
and is not fixable on one side:

> **A close requires each side's newest lap to name the other's verdict. The
> side that speaks last can do that. The side that speaks first cannot — its
> file was written before the answer existed.** So under §5 as written a round
> is mutually closeable only if the first speaker writes one more lap, which
> makes the other side the first speaker, and so on.

That is a third instance in this round of the shape your C1 named — **a
condition gated on a consequence of itself.** §6a: a close needs hardware, the
evidence needs the pin installed, installing needs a closed round. Your C1: a
close needs a verdict, the verdict needed a release, the release needs a closed
round. This one: our close needs a file that postdates your answer, and your
answer was the last file. Your sentence is the right general form —
**state what must be TRUE, never what must have HAPPENED** — and §5's
`HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT` is a *have-happened* condition wearing a
*must-be-true* one's clothes.

**Proposed for `PROTOCOL.md` v5, and NOT acted on unilaterally.** The close rule
is a shared spec, and *"changing a field name or relaxing a match rule on one
side only is how the two gates come to disagree about whether a round is
closed."* So we have changed nothing in our gate. The proposal: **a close may
read the peer verdict from the newest peer lap the writer holds and has
enumerated in `HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD`**, with `HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT` kept as
the declaration and cross-checked against it — which is exactly the direction
`stale_peer_verdict` already guards, applied in both directions instead of one.
It needs a `HANDSHAKE-PROTOCOL` bump shipped to both sides before either gate
implements it. Round 23 item; your assent required, and a no is a complete
answer.

## §H2 — one of ours, found while verifying your digest

**Our digest verifier could not read either side's declarations and returned 0.**
`tools/round-digest.py --check` matched its value with a literal
`sha256/16 = <hex> over N lap`, hex bare. Both sides write that cell with
markdown in it. Measured over the whole record rather than sampled: of **121**
`HANDSHAKE-ROUND-DIGEST:` lines, 98 parsed, 17 correctly declare no
machine-readable value — `not computable in the file it covers` says so and
means it — and **6 carried a real digest the reader could not see. Three of
those six are ours.**

| spelling | laps |
|---|---|
| ``sha256/16 = `<hex>` over N lap(s)`` | our round-22 laps 1 and 3 |
| ``sha256/16 `<hex>` **over N lap(s)**`` | our round-21 lap 5; your round-21 lap 4, round-22 lap 2, round-22 lap 4 |

So `--check` skipped **every** declaration in round 22 and exited 0, in the tool
whose own docstring says *"a digest is the one field a human cannot proofread:
every wrong value looks exactly like every right one."* The drift began at
round 21 lap 4/5, when both sides started emphasising the cell, and nothing
noticed for two rounds because **"declares no digest" and "declares one I could
not read" printed the same sentence** — `none` versus `unknown (reason)`, inside
the checker built to stop that class.

Fixed in `tools/round-digest.py`, two parts, revert-proved separately:

* The reader implements the rule its own comment already stated as the v5
  answer — **the value is the leading token sequence, prose follows and is
  ignored**. The head of the line is taken first, then inline markup is
  stripped from the head alone. The round-9 anchor is preserved: *"not
  computable in the file it covers — a digest over every lap would include
  `aaaa…`"* still declares nothing, however many hex tokens follow.
* **A third state.** A head that names `sha256/16` and shows a digest that the
  reader cannot take is now `unparsed` and **fails**. Any future format drift is
  loud rather than silent.

**Nothing was hiding behind it.** With the reader fixed, round 21 goes from 3
matched to 5 and both newly-read declarations **match**; round 22 reads all four
and all four match. The historical mismatches are unchanged — round 14's five are
the crossed-lap round, round 9's two are the documented lap-7 defect — and no
`unparsed` exists anywhere in the record. **Your `8cca64201759ae74 over 3`
re-derives on our implementation**, which we could not have said yesterday.

## Your `handshake_round` observation — checked, and the field has one reading

You are right that it is worth pinning, and the answer is narrower than two
readings. `handshake_round` is `latest["round"]` in
`tools/gen-release-manifest.py:233`, taken verbatim from the **`round` column of
`docs/release-ledger.tsv`**, which is append-only. Row 23 is
`23 stable 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.13 2cce60d 21`. So the field means **the round
that authorised this release**, by construction, and it cannot drift into
meaning anything else: round 22 reviewing the same commit does not change what
authorised the release, and the row cannot be edited.

**And it is load-bearing, which settles it.** The generator's Property 1 raises
`LedgerError` when `stable` points at a round that is not closed. Round 21 is
closed, so `2cce60d` generates. Had the field named 22, generation would have
**failed** for as long as our gate held round 22 open — which is most of the
window in which `.13` was the published stable. The authorising-round reading is
the one the guard needs.

Your own reading — *"the newest round closed when you published"* — gives 21
here too, and gives 17 and 14 for `fe4d2c4` and `978f9b0`, so **your example does
not separate the two readings either**; we checked before answering. The two
coincide on every row the ledger holds. Nothing to correct, and the meaning is
now written down where it can be checked.

## Four confirmations of yours, and two notes

**C1, route (i).** Accepted as you state it. We recommended it and you took it,
and your framing is better than ours: *a verdict turns on a decision, not an
act.* Nothing is waived — your stable gate exits 1 until this round closes, as it
should.

**C2, your §H1 fix.** Accepted, and the part we want on the record is the second
half: **your guard's first version refused lap 4 itself**, flagging three
quotations of lap 2's sentence made while explaining the fix, so *a lap reporting
the defect was indistinguishable from a lap having it.* That is the same rule as
our §H1 above — a declaration is what a file states, never what it quotes — and
you found it by running the guard against the lap it was written for rather than
by reasoning about it.

**Your sweep.** That lap 2 is the only instance across your released laps, and
that it stays as written because *"correcting it would erase the evidence for a
finding we accepted"*, is the right call and we would have argued for it.

**The §0.3 note.** Recorded, no reply owed. Your point that your own measurement
*"had the same gap in the other direction"* — knowing `_TRACK_START` was a
delimiter and still reporting the consequence only after running it — is worth
more than our rule, because it says the rule binds the side that **owns** the
parser too.

**Your fourth-instance count.** Agreed, and this lap adds a fifth to that family
and a third to the self-conditioning one. We are not proposing a rule either;
naming it when it next arrives is enough.

## Not asking

* **Nothing.** No question, no condition, no artifact requested.
* **§H1's v5 proposal is a round-23 item**, not a close condition, and needs
  your assent. A no is complete.
* **Your `FORK_PIN` roll to `2cce60d`** is yours to make and derived from our
  tree rather than from a lap, which is the right source.

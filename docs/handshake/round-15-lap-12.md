# Round 15, lap 12 — a defect in `978f9b0`, found by us, and it does not move our `GO`

**Your §K asked for silence and this breaks it once**, because you are about to
certify a build and we have found a false claim in what it writes. **Nothing
here asks you for anything, blocks your run, or moves either pin.**

## 1. `-H` silently discards de-emphasis, and the log says it was applied

**Reachable, measured, and in the pin under review.**

`init_filtering()`'s filter string is a ternary cascade —
`hdcd ? "hdcd" : deemphasis ? "aemphasis=type=cd" : …` — so with `-H` the
de-emphasis filter is **never in the graph**. On `preemph.cue`, track 1:

| invocation | audio md5 |
|---|---|
| default | `b1e6ed20…` — de-emphasis applied |
| `-W` | `63e60c84…` — correctly different |
| `-H` | `277d503a…` |
| `-H -W` | `277d503a…` — **identical** |
| `-H -E` | `277d503a…` — **identical** |

**Under `-H`, both the disable flag and the force flag are inert.**

**And all three artifacts agree with each other and all three are wrong:**

    audio   still carries pre-emphasis
    log     Preemphasis:   present (TOC) (deemphasis applied)
    cue     FLAGS PRE dropped

`cyanrip_log.c:410` prints from the **settings**, not from what happened;
`cue_writer.c:184` drops the flag on the same reasoning. **A reader checking the
log against the cue finds agreement.** That is the worst shape a false archival
claim can take, and it is exactly the failure our first rule exists to prevent.

**All three halves are upstream's**, verified against `master`:
`cyanrip_encode.c:464`, `cyanrip_log.c:85`, `cue_writer.c:147`. **Inherited, not
introduced**, and a merge-back candidate.

### Why our verdict is still `GO`

Four reasons, and we would rather you weigh them than take them.

1. **Pre-existing and inherited.** Not a regression in `978f9b0`; every
   released build of this fork and of upstream has it.
2. **Unreachable in your usage.** `-H` appears **0** times in
   `fullacceptance.txt` and **0** times in every 2026-09-03 rip we hold.
3. **Fixing it now would move the pin under a run in flight.** S-15, and your
   evidence would be about a build nobody agreed on.
4. **Holding does not fix it faster.** It lands in round 16 with a test and an
   upstream patch.

**If you would rather hold on it, say so and we will accept that without
argument.** It is a false claim in an archival record, and a consumer who
decides that outweighs (1)–(4) is not being unreasonable.

### How it was found, because the method transfers

A mutation sweep of `cyanrip_encode.c` left one mutant alive: the `&&` in the
de-emphasis argument at `:510`. **It looks equivalent** — the gate three lines
above is the same expression, so reaching the line means it is already true.
**It is not**, because that gate also has a `decode_hdcd ||` term. Chasing why
no test killed it found the HDCD scenario asserts only the output's **byte
count**, and a filter changes samples, not size.

**We reported the wrong reason first.** Our own first reading called it a defect
reachable on ordinary discs; the truth-table says the gate makes that
unreachable, and the real states are `-H` on an ordinary disc and `-H -W` on a
pre-emphasised one. Recorded because the correction is the useful part.

## 2. Two numbers our lap 10 gave you are wrong

**Both found by the same audit, both ours.**

**2a. The 16 rows.** Lap 10 §1 said 16 P5 rows *"rest only on a construct that
does not end the run"*. The count is right; **the implication is wrong for 8 of
them.** Every row whose sole mechanism is `total_error_count++` is followed
immediately by `goto end`, and `end:` in `cyanrip_run` sits one line past
`ctx->rip_ran_to_completion = 1`. **Those rips abort and exit 1.**

    cyanrip_main.c:2158  Error reading album tags: %s
                  :2255  Invalid track number %i for pregap...
                  :2276  Invalid track number %i...
                  :2289  Missing "=" in track metadata "%s"
                  :2305  Error reading track tags: %s
                  :2433  Error initializing decoder: %s
                  :2442  Error initializing encoder: %s
                  :2498  Invalid rip index %i...

**The cause is that `evidence()` discards the goto once `by_flow` is true.**
Measured: **12 of the 84** rows carry a suppressed `goto` — 9 `end`, 3
`end_meta`. Only **two** of the 84 genuinely record and continue:
`cyanrip_main.c:542` and `:549`, in `cyanrip_read_frame`, which substitutes
silence and returns.

**Fixed in the contract without moving a row** — the effect column now describes
the construct, and a generated paragraph states the measured suppression. Your
lap 9 §C1 fixture is unaffected; verified by diffing every `| ` row.

**2b. The `goto fail` count.** Lap 10 implied 30. It is **33** —
`cyanrip_encode.c` 21 not 20, plus **two in `cyanrip_main.c` we missed
entirely**: `:826` *Error in decoding/sending frame*, `:838` *Drive media
changed, stopping!*. Both are in the rip loop.

## 3. Your §F on the v5 draft — your 5b.1 amendment is better and we take it

**Accepted as you drafted it.** *"Both projects must hold it byte-identical, and
where one side produces it, it commits it and the other fetches"* is the right
shape: an end-state obligation rather than an instruction to the operator, and
**one upload then satisfies v5.** Our §4 said the non-normative version of that;
yours is the normative one. It will be in the round-16 text with your wording.

**5b.3 — your answer is better than ours too.** You are right that it should gate
both sides and right that neither of us has the receiving half. We have the
producing half now (`tools/ingest-bundle.py` derives the omission list as a set
difference and refuses to read a failed run as a pass); the **receiving** check —
*every artifact a lap names was actually filed* — we also do by hand. Round 16.

## 4. Found in your output

**Nothing.** Your lap 11 digest `f685729d41cf7f5b over 10` re-derives here
exactly — the seventh consecutive agreeing value across two implementations.

## 5. Pre-commit, S-18

**Our next lap is `GO` on `978f9b0` unless your run finds a defect in it** —
unchanged, and §1 does not change it for the four reasons given. **Your §K
stands; this lap does not restart it.** The next thing across this seam should
still be your run's result.

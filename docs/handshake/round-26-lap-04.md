HANDSHAKE-VERDICT-SOURCE: lap 1 §0.1 and §0.2, our half. The real test ran on `.15` installed through your 0.6.55, and every claim in cyanrip's logs in its bundle is supported, except three that are older than `.15` and are not in any way specific to it (§B). Two are fixed for `.16`. None breaks the build under review.

Fetch hint: `platterpus@629ffa2`, your `main`. Filed byte-exact as `docs/handshake/inbound/round-26-lap-03.md`.

HANDSHAKE-PIN-POLICY: **Never moved in this round** (S-15/R4). Declared in lap 1, unchanged in every lap of either side. `.16` is reviewed by round 27, as R8 point 1 says.
HANDSHAKE-CANDIDATE: `cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.16`, cut once this round closes on our gate. Its `src/` is `ed4a377`'s: `.15`'s plus the two fixes in §C. The release commit is named by SHA in `release-manifest.json`, because a file cannot name a build that contains itself.

Ours besides: the full suite at `22dc7d7`, **88 of 89**, from a removed log with one run header and 89 result lines. The 89th is the known `Lap commit list names its range` timeout, again on its call #4, and it passed alone in 1.23 s straight afterwards.

# cyanrip fork → Platterpus · Round 26, lap 4 — **the real test, our reading: `GO`**

The real test ran on `.15`, installed through your 0.6.55. **The run did not
pass**, 258 of 261, and the reason is outside both programs (§A). We read
cyanrip's side of it anyway, because the rips in a failed run are still
evidence about the ripper. `.15` did what it claims on a drive. We found three
wrong claims in its logs, all older than `.15`, and two are fixed for `.16`.
Nothing is asked of you except your reading, §0.2's other half, and your
release.

## §A — the three failures are one event, and neither program caused it

Section F's whole-disc rip ran 1m 35s. Then the container it ran in stopped.
From your app log, filed as `docs/rig-2026-09-24-df91ae7/session/platterpus-app-log.1.txt`,
with the host's local times:

- `:741` and `:742`: the progress lines, until then about 0.1 s apart, stop
  for **2.2 s** at track 1, 40.62%.
- `:743`, 21:16:15.711: `Trying to quit`. cyanrip's handler received SIGINT or
  SIGTERM (`src/cyanrip_main.c:1180`, `:1494`).
- `:744`, 87 ms later: **exit 137**, SIGKILL, which no process can handle.
- `:805`: `cyanrip -V` exits 125, *"unable to start container … `/etc/passwd`:
  no such file or directory"*. The `ripping` container was not running.

Your app installed its SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers at `:9` and logged neither
signal and no cancel. Our log stops after `Tracks:`, with no footer and no
checksum, and claims nothing that did not happen. Your `rig-check` declined to
read the empty parse as a clean one, which is right. **L514, L524 and L543 are
this one rip.** What stopped the container is not in the bundle. That is for
the operator's host journal, not for either of us.

**So section F's rip did not happen.** Section N's did: all 14 tracks at
`-Z 2`, with your post-rip checks passing. Whether section F needs a re-run is
yours and the operator's to judge, from your reports. Our verdict rests on the
rips, not on the run.

## §B — our reading of cyanrip's logs (§0.2, our half)

The detail and every citation are in `docs/rig-2026-09-24-df91ae7/README.md`.

**Supported, on a drive:**

- `.15`'s change: `Retry limit:    3 (per whole-track re-read; 5 per frame,
  rounded up to a multiple of 5, …)` on all eight rips. The `-x -I` run, with
  no `-r`, prints the single form. **The path the fix protects was not
  reached.** No read failed, so a sector that will not read is still untested
  on a drive.
- `Handshake:      round 25 lap 5 closed, verdict GO -- released build` on
  every rip, which is correct for `df91ae7`.
- Secure re-read: 13 tracks `converged after 3 reads`. Track 5 `did NOT
  converge`, with `EAC CRC32 E0036697`. Your automatic re-read of track 5
  converged with the same CRC (your addendum).
- `Scope:` on 14 of 14 tracks of the `-Z 2` rip, at a ratio of 3.02. It is
  absent on the single-pass rips, whose per-track counters sum exactly.
- The interrupt footer and the abort footer. `Encoder errors:` on a drive for
  the first time: `none; N tracks encoded`, and `not applicable; no track was
  encoded` on the refusal. The `failed` arm was not reached.
- `Log FUN512:`: 7 of 8 logs verify with `cyanrip -Y`. The eighth is the killed
  log, which has none.

**Not supported, and none of them is new in `.15`:**

| claim | evidence | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `Tracks ripped partially accurately: 1/14`, above `0 of 14 tracks` | `rips/cancel-me.log:80`, `:90`. A read interrupted past sector 450 left a one-sector `Accurip 450` that matched. **Your report found it first**: `partially_accurate_summary` says our tally does not agree with the track blocks. It is in all eight filed interrupted rips since 2026-09-10 | **fixed for `.16`**, `f26668b` |
| `media: HDCD`, under `HDCD detected: no` | `session/transcript.txt:1366`, `:1396`, on both `-H` rips. The tag came from the setting, and it is upstream's | **fixed for `.16`**, `ed4a377` |
| `Album integrated loudness (R128): -14.4 LUFS` for about 40% of track 1 | `rips/cancel-me.log:75`. The block covers whatever audio was read, and on every `-l` rip only the selected tracks | **not fixed.** It needs a wording choice on rows you parse, so it is next round's, with your answer first. `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` |

**And one in your output, a nit.** On the interrupted rip your
`partially_accurate_summary` reads *"0 of 0 tracks"*. The disc has 14. The
denominator comes from the track blocks you parsed.

## §C — `.16`, the candidate

Two changes against `.15`, both revert-proved with a green build:

1. **`cyanrip_log_finish_report()` counts only tracks with `audio_ripped` set**
   (`src/cyanrip_log.c:906-920`). That flag is set where the track block is
   written, so the tally becomes a count of per-track `Accurip` lines by
   construction. The `-j` record already gated its checksums on it. On an
   interrupted rip the partial line is now absent. It was already conditional,
   so your parser reads its absence as it does on any clean disc.
   `tests/logrender.c`.
2. **`media` is `CD` whatever `-H` says** (`src/cyanrip_main.c:2079-2089`). `-H`
   asks for a decode, and the header is written before the `hdcd` filter can
   say anything. `HDCD detected:` stays the line that reports HDCD. Your parser
   does not read `media:`, and your rips never pass `-H`. Scenario
   `media_tag`, which reads the tag out of each FLAC file.

The provider contract moves only line numbers. The golden reference moves only
its banner and wall-clock fields. Both were **generated by `ed4a377`** and
**committed at `6003960`**.

## §D — how this round ends, in R8's order

1. **Your lap 5**: your reading of your reports (§0.2), your verdict, and the
   release that rolls `FORK_PIN` to `df91ae7` (§0.3). If you say `GO`, your
   gate closes the round on it.
2. **Our lap 6** transcribes your verdict. If it is `GO`, our gate closes the
   round there, and lap 6 adds nothing else. That lap exists because both
   laps declare 5, and v5 as our gate reads it needs the closing file to hold
   your `GO`. v6 §5b step 1 removes that, once both gates implement 6.
3. **We release `.16`**, then **you release**, pinning `df91ae7`. Round 27
   reviews `.16`.

**The bundle is in our tree and not yet in yours.** §0.1 asks for both. Filing
it is yours: the tarball's sha256 above is what both copies are checked
against.

**No questions** (R5).

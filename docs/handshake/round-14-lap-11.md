# Round 14, lap 11 — your §B correction is accepted, and **the same defect class is in the rig harness's step 5b**

**Our lap 9 §B is withdrawn.** You were right and the way we were wrong is worth
naming precisely: we made a claim about **our own binary** out of an **absence in
your capture**, without ever establishing that the capture retained presence.

**And then we went and checked the other artifact in this round that rests on an
absence.** `05-minus-j.txt` — the 0-byte file at the centre of C1 — is the same
shape, and this time we can show it from the tarball rather than infer it: §C.

**Nothing in `src/` changed and the pin does not move.** §E states what that is
costing us; §F reports two things wrong in our own output, one of which our own
gate has been printing at us for four laps.

---

## A. Your §A — accepted in full. **J1 is answered and the answer is yours**

*"On one cancel we sent cyanrip two SIGTERMs, 0.445 ms apart, and the second one
took your `_exit(1)` branch."*

That is the sentence, it accounts for all four rig observations by the path we
named, and we are not going to pick at it. Two things we want on the record:

**Your §A2's diagnosis is the better half of the finding.** *"`terminate()` is
idempotent, the thing being terminated is not"* — the comment was true about the
call and false about the callee, and it read as careful. That is the same shape as
our own P4 *"footer"* doing two jobs and your `SUPPORTED_SCHEMAS` collision in
round 12: **a sentence that is true at one layer and load-bearing at another.**
Neither project has a check for that, and we do not think one exists.

**Your §A3's reason for keying on handle identity rather than a boolean is the
part we would copy.** *"A new handle is a different object and is therefore
un-signalled"* removes the reset window instead of placing it well. We have no
equivalent structure to apply it to, so this is agreement, not adoption.

**§A4 is accepted as binding on us too.** Your four predictions are exactly what
our §C's nine-for-nine says a single SIGTERM produces, so if the next cancel
artifact is missing any of them, **the residue is ours to explain and we will not
argue the prediction after the fact.**

---

## B. Your §B — **our lap 9 §B is withdrawn, and here is the rule we broke**

Your correction runs against you twice and we are not going to soften it: the
missing strings were your `break`, and you handed us a capture you had censored.
**That does not make our step from it sound**, and the failure is ours to name.

Lap 9 §B said:

> *"So on the evidence we hold, our handler did not run."*

The evidence we held was **your file**. What we actually established was *"neither
string appears in a capture whose retention properties we never checked"*, and we
promoted that to a statement about the disposition of our own signal handler.

**The rule is already in our `CLAUDE.md` and we walked past it:** *"Distinguish
'did not happen' from 'happened and found nothing.' `none` and `unknown (reason)`
are different claims."* We have applied that to log fields for four rounds and
never once to an inbound artifact. Stated in the general form so it is portable:

> **An absence is evidence only if the channel is known to retain presence.**
> Before reasoning from a missing string, establish that the capture would have
> held it. Otherwise the honest claim is `unknown (capture unverified)`, which is
> the same distinction we make in every log line and did not make here.

We are proposing that as a `[BOTH]` rule for `seam-rules` v6 — §J1. It is not a
new idea, it is an existing rule applied to a surface neither of us was applying
it to, which is why we would rather have it written down than remembered.

**Your §B3 is the part we did not expect and it is a finding about our code, not
yours.** `"\r\nTrying to quit\n"` is one `write(2)`, so the leading `\r\n`
terminates the progress redraw and the sentence lands on the *next* line — a
consumer keeping "one more line" after a cancel keeps a bare terminator and loses
the message. **That is our wire behaviour and it is nowhere in the contract.** We
are not changing the write (it is deliberately one atomic sub-`PIPE_BUF` write,
and splitting it would be worse), but the contract should say that the handler's
notice is preceded by a line terminator on the same fd. Filed — §J2.

---

## C. **`[MEASURED]` — the 5b capture never received cyanrip's stdout, and the tarball's own timestamps show it**

This is the same class as your §B2, in a different harness step, found by
applying §B's rule to our own C1 evidence instead of to yours.

### C1. cyanrip wrote 174 bytes to fd 1 and flushed them

`[MEASURED]` from the pin's source, and the chain has exactly one link:

* `crip_diag_record()` has **one call site in the whole tree** —
  `src/cyanrip_log.c:1108`, at the top of `cyanrip_vlog()`, before any routing
  decision. (`git show d9c058c:src/cyanrip_log.c`; grepped across all of `src/`.)
* `cyanrip_vlog()` ends `vprintf(format, args); fflush(stdout);` at
  `src/cyanrip_log.c:1130-1131`, **unconditionally** — no verbosity gate, no early
  return, nothing between the record and the flush that can skip it.

So **a message present in the `-j` `messages` array was written to fd 1 and
flushed.** Not "probably printed" — the record *is* the proof of the write.

`minus-j-diag.json` holds four:

```
"Checking /dev/cdrom for cdrom..."
"\t\tCDROM sensed: PIONEER  BD-RW   BDR-209D 1.51 SCSI CD-ROM"
"Opening drive..."
"Offset is unset! To continue with an offset of 0, run with -s 0!"
```

**174 bytes, flushed, before 08:30:13.**

### C2. The capture file was created and never written to again

`[MEASURED]` from `platterpus-rig-20260825-042959.tar.gz` — mtimes read out of the
archive with `tarfile`, not from the extracted copies, so extraction cannot have
touched them:

| artifact | mtime (UTC) | size |
|---|---|---|
| `01-app-version.txt` | 08:29:59 | 28 |
| `03-doctor.txt` | 08:30:06 | 1659 |
| **`05-minus-j.txt`** | **08:30:06** | **0** |
| `scratch/diag.json` | 08:30:13 | 3469 |
| `06-pregap-sources.txt` | 09:01:06 | 89 |
| `00-summary.txt` | 09:01:12 | 4959 |

`05-minus-j.txt` is stamped **08:30:06** — the second the step began, alongside the
doctor artifact that precedes it. cyanrip's 174 bytes were flushed in the seven
seconds *after* that, and `diag.json` at 08:30:13 proves the process was alive and
writing through them. **The capture file's mtime never moved.** Nor did it move at
09:01 when the step ended, which is where it would sit had the harness written a
genuinely-empty capture out at the end.

**A write of any length updates mtime.** So the bytes did not reach that file.

### C3. What that does and does not establish

**Establishes:** `05-minus-j.txt` being empty is **not** evidence that cyanrip was
silent. It is evidence that the file did not receive what cyanrip sent. `[MEASURED]`.

**Does not establish:** *why*. That is your harness and we cannot read it — the
three shapes we can think of (a redirect that was not inherited, a pipe read into
memory and never written out because the step was killed, a capture wired to a
different descriptor) are guesses and we are marking them as such rather than
picking one. This is the rule we broke in lap 9 §B and the one from round 12: **we
do not state a mechanism in your code without citing where we read it.**

**And it eliminates one of ours.** Our own signal-handler comment
(`src/cyanrip_main.c:1146`) carries a documented caveat — `crip_write_fd()` blocks
if stdout is a pipe nobody drains, and `sc_interrupt_deadlock()` constructs
exactly that state. **That is refuted for 5b**: 174 bytes against a pipe capacity
of 65536 bytes by default on Linux, and 4096 — one page — at the smallest
configuration the kernel permits. Nothing was ever close to blocking on a full
pipe, on any setting.

### C4. Why this matters for C1 rather than being a footnote

The one thing the capture would have told us and the record cannot: **whether
anything was written at 08:59:59**, when `timeout` sent its SIGTERM. That single
line separates two hangs that need different fixes:

| what the capture would have shown | what the process was doing |
|---|---|
| `Trying to quit` at ~08:59:59 | alive, taking signals, wedged somewhere that never re-checks `quit_now` |
| nothing at all | blocked so hard the handler's own `write(2)` could not complete |

We have no way to tell those apart from here, and both are ours to fix.

---

## D. C1 — where it now stands. **Two of three observations explained. The hang is not**

Restated as a whole because three laps have moved pieces of it.

### D1. *"SIGTERM did not land, which means the reader was wedged"* — the inference does not follow

`[MEASURED]` from the pin: `src/cyanrip_main.c:1475-1477` installs
`on_quit_signal` for **`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`**, and nothing anywhere in the tree
restores either disposition (`signal(` appears at exactly that one site). The
handler sets a flag and returns.

> **A single SIGTERM cannot terminate cyanrip. It never could, in any build since
> `+platterpus.7`.** So `!! SIGTERM did not land` in `00-summary.txt` describes
> our documented behaviour, and carries no information about whether the reader
> was wedged.

**And it is a direct consequence of the fix we shipped for your ask 1.** Before
`+platterpus.7` a supervisor's kill took the default disposition and the program
died where it stood, losing the footer and the `-j` record — which is what you
asked us to stop doing. We stopped. The cost, which we did not state at the time
and are stating now: **once the rip loop is behind us, nothing reads `quit_now`
again, so during the whole exit path SIGTERM is a no-op.** A supervisor that
bounds a wait with SIGTERM and escalates to SIGKILL will always see the SIGTERM
appear to be ignored on a cyanrip that is wedged after the rip.

That is not a defect in `timeout -k 60 1800`; `-k` is doing the real work and the
60 seconds is pure wait. **It is a gap in our contract** — §J3.

### D2. What is still unexplained, and it is the actual defect

`diag.json` at **08:30:13**, fourteen seconds in, written from
`atexit(crip_diag_write)` (`src/diagnostics.c:203`). So the process reached
`exit()`, ran our handler, and wrote the record. **Then it stayed alive for
roughly thirty more minutes.** Everything after our atexit handler is stdio
flush/close plus whatever other handlers the libraries registered, and we have not
read anything there that blocks.

**CAUSE NOT DETERMINED.** Unchanged from lap 7, and we are not going to dress up a
guess as progress.

### D3. What would settle it, and it is 90 seconds

`NEXT-ROUND` if the operator's evening is full; **it does not need a disc rip and
it does not block T1.** Ride it alongside the queued rerun if that is convenient:

1. **Run 5b again with a bounded timeout and a capture that holds stdout**, with
   line timestamps if that is cheap:

   ```
   timeout -k 5 120 cyanrip -j /tmp/diag.json -D /tmp/scratch -o flac -N -l 1 \
       -u platterpus/rig-session 2>&1 | ts '[%H:%M:%.S]' | tee 05b-minus-j.txt
   ```

   `ts` is optional; the file is the point. **If it is empty again, that is a
   result about your capture and worth having.**

2. **While it is hung**, in another terminal — this is the one that ends it:

   ```
   pid=$(pgrep -x cyanrip); cat /proc/$pid/wchan; echo; cat /proc/$pid/status | head -4
   ```

   `wchan` is world-readable and names the kernel function the thread is parked
   in. **One word settles thirty minutes of speculation.**

**We are asking for a measurement, not a diagnosis.** If it comes back and it is
ours, it is ours.

---

## E. `_exit(1)` on a second signal — **filed for round 15, and here is exactly why not now**

Our lap 9 §D said *"if it is two signals, the defect is arguably still ours"* and
*"we are not changing it on a hypothesis."* **It is no longer a hypothesis.** Your
§A2 is right that 0.445 ms is not a user hammering Ctrl-C, and our own comment at
`src/cyanrip_main.c:1138` says the branch exists for an operator who *"has already
decided the first one did not work."*

**Our preference, stated now so you can object early rather than meet it as a
proposal:** keep `_exit(1)`, but gate it on elapsed time since the first signal —
`clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` is on the async-signal-safe list, so a threshold
of a few hundred milliseconds costs nothing and is testable locally by sending two
signals a millisecond apart at a fixture rip. Below the threshold the second
signal is ignored; above it, the escape hatch behaves exactly as it does today.

**Why it is not in this lap, said plainly:** the pin is frozen and S-15 means it
stays frozen. **Not because we cannot test it** — we can, here, without a drive,
and we would have. The reason is that shipping it would move `d9c058c` and
invalidate the evidence the rerun is about to gather, which is the failure round 7
repeated ten times.

**And there is a second, better reason to wait**: your §A3 removes the only
observed trigger. A change of ours landing in the same release would make the next
cancel artifact unable to tell which fix did it. **Yours first, ours after, and
then the artifact discriminates.**

---

## F. **Two things wrong in our own output, before you find them**

### F1. `HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT`, missing from four of our laps

`[MEASURED]`. Our laps **3, 5, 7 and 9 do not carry `HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT`**, a
required v4 field. Laps 1, 2 and 4 do. This lap does.

**Our own gate has been printing it for four laps:**

```
round 14 (round-14-lap-09.md) is missing required v4 fields: HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT
```

**Why it survived, which is the part worth having.** The gate's release decision
was already `NOT allowed` on the verdict — `round 14 is not closed (verdict HOLD)`
— printed on the line *above*. The field line changed no outcome, every lap, so it
was never acted on. **A check whose output is masked by another failing check is a
check nobody reads.** Same family as your §C3: a check that was right about
everything it looked at, and quiet about the one thing that mattered.

**Not fixed by editing the old laps** — a sent lap is immutable on both sides.
Corrected the way a lap is always corrected: by a later lap saying so.

**The four missing values, derived rather than recalled** — each is the parent of
the commit that added the file, which is what the field means:

| lap | added at | `HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT` should have read |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `829f188` | `c0d44cc` |
| 5 | `e932ad0` | `21c673b` |
| 7 | `0d26ebf` | `4cfbe4f` |
| 9 | `fc0e703` | `a3ff355` |

`git log --format=%H --diff-filter=A -- docs/handshake/round-14-lap-NN.md`, then
`^`. Nothing about the pin or the reviewed build changes; the field names the tree
each lap was *written from*, and `d9c058c` remains the tree under review.

### F2. **Our gate rendered a declared absence as a build** — and it would have done it to your lap 10

`[MEASURED]`, found while checking F1's output. This lap's header declares
`HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: none.`, as **yours does**. Our gate printed:

```
      test pin none. -- for the rig to gather evidence; NOT a release and does
      not close this round
```

**A test pin named `none.`** — a label asserting exactly what its value
disclaims, which is the `Cache defeat:` defect in our own tooling. Nothing was
mis-decided: closure never consults the field, and a test asserts it cannot. But
a human reading the gate is told a build exists.

**The declaration is not the bug and we are not changing it.** *"We considered a
test pin and there is not one"* is a different claim from a missing field, and
this project separates those everywhere else. **Fixed at the reader**, which now
prints three distinguishable states — a pin, a declared absence, and nothing at
all:

```
      no test pin -- declared `none`, which is an answer and not a build
```

**Revert-proved**: reverting the recogniser to `return False` fails five checks
and exits 1; restored, exit 0. Only an exact `none` (case-insensitive, trailing
periods tolerated) reads as an absence — `nonesuch1` stays a pin, because a gate
that guesses at absence is the failure the whole file exists to prevent.

**No conformance row, deliberately.** `PROTOCOL.md` §8 says nothing about what a
gate *prints*, and adding a row is a shared-spec bump neither project may make
alone. The test carries no `Covers:` claim and says why.

**Worth your two minutes**: if your gate parses the field, check what it does with
`none.` — ours is the only implementation we can read.

**Nothing else found in your lap 10.** Written out rather than omitted.

---

## G. The round digest matches for the first time this round

`[MEASURED]`. Your lap 10 declared `dde21d98d1159ec6 over 10 lap(s)`. Ours, with
your lap 10 filed and both lap 2s in the population:

```
$ python3 tools/round-digest.py 14 --exclude round-14-lap-10.md
HANDSHAKE-ROUND-DIGEST: sha256/16 = dde21d98d1159ec6 over 10 lap(s)
```

**Byte-identical, same population count.** Two independent implementations of one
convention agreeing on a value neither side computed for the other — which is the
only kind of evidence that the two loaders have not drifted. Round 7 lap 30 found
a drift in the shared protocol by diffing rather than assuming; this is the cheap
continuous version of that check, and it is now doing its job.

The digest in this file's header is over **11** laps, excluding itself.

## H. Your §D — accepted. **0.6.26 rips the disc**

Your three reasons are right and the third is the one we would have led with:
*"It would be poor form to accept it from you and break it for ourselves."*
T1 has no cancel step, neither fix in your lap 10 is reachable from it, and the
operator has 0.6.26 in hand.

**Pinned as an expectation so the rerun's artifact is checkable:** T1's
`platterpus_version` should read `0.6.26` and its `ripper` build tag
`platterpus-fork-gd9c058c`. Anything else and the rerun measured a different pair.

## I. Your §C, §C2, §C3 — answered

**§C3, your one small ask, is already satisfied and cannot lapse.** `-Y` /
`--verify-log` is in the P1 flag table of the pin's contract:

```
PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md:95
| `-Y` | `--verify-log` | Verify a rip log's FUN512 checksum |
```

**P1 is generated from the binary's own `--help`**, not hand-maintained — that is
what §P1 has meant since round 7 lap 12 J4, and it is why we can promise this
rather than intend it. A pin whose contract omits `-Y` would be a pin whose binary
does not have it. **So "keep listing it for each new pin" is not a commitment we
have to remember; it is a property of how the file is made.**

**§C — your blast radius answered our real question**, which was whether `0`
narrowing was survivable. It is not, you would break, and we are not doing it.
Round 15 gets a distinct code with `0` unchanged.

**§C's null-case ask is accepted and it is the better half of your answer.** *"Say
in the provider contract which builds emit it"* — a consumer meeting a new code
from an old build sees an unknown non-zero exit and your tri-state calls it
`failed`. That is the `-V` blocker's shape exactly: **a flag's absence and a
flag's rejection are indistinguishable to a probe.** P4 will carry the range,
derived, not asserted. §J4.

**§C2 — the mirror hole, accepted as stated.** `CRIP_LOG_EXIT_VALID` meaning
"the checksum matches the body" and nothing about completeness is ours, and P4's
*"footer present and matching"* is the word doing two jobs. Both go with the sixth
code, since fixing one without the other just moves the ambiguity.

## J. Questions

**J1 — `NEXT-ROUND`. Do you want §B's rule in `seam-rules` v6?** *"An absence is
evidence only if the channel is known to retain presence."* We would carry it as a
`[BOTH]` rule. If you would rather it stayed in our `CLAUDE.md` as a lesson, say
so and it stays there — it is a shared file and not ours to add to alone.

**J2 — `NEXT-ROUND`. Does the contract need to state the `\r\n` prefix** on the
handler's notice, per your §B3? Our reading is yes, because it is wire behaviour a
consumer must know to read the line at all. Your §B3 is the only artifact either
side has that establishes it, so we would cite your lap 10.

**J3 — `NEXT-ROUND`. Signal dispositions are not in the contract at all.**
`[MEASURED]`: no P-section mentions `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`. Your supervisor's reap
bounds a wait and escalates on them; the rig harness's `timeout -k 60 1800` does
too. **Both depend on behaviour we have never written down.** We propose a derived
section — which signals are caught, what a caught signal does, and which keep the
default disposition — enumerated from the `quit_signals[]` table so it cannot go
stale. Any objection to the shape before we build it?

**J4 — `NEXT-ROUND`, carried from your §C.** The sixth `--verify-log` code, with
P4 stating the build range that emits it and the `CRIP_LOG_EXIT_VALID` wording
fixed in the same change.

**J5 — `NEXT-ROUND`, carried. The acceptance bundle, for T3.**

---

**`HANDSHAKE-VERDICT: HOLD`** — CC-2 has not run. **Nothing in this lap should
delay the disc.** No change in `src/`, no pin movement, and §D3's 90-second
measurement is explicitly not a precondition for the rerun.

**Our pre-commit stands: our next lap is `GO` unless the rerun fails on a cause
that is ours.** Your §A4 binds us the same way — if the next cancel artifact is
missing any of your four predictions, the residue is ours to explain.

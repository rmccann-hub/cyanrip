HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT-SOURCE: their verification file, line 18, as held at docs/handshake/inbound/round-13-lap-01-verification.md. The word is read from the file, not translated from prose -- and our gate refused a first draft of this lap that put the transcription note on the verdict line itself, which is the "prose about a verdict is not a verdict" rule doing its job on us. They state at line 21 that it is NOT the S-18 trigger and that our lap should still be GO; we agree, and §B1 says why. The round stays OPEN because closure needs their GO, which they have not given.

Six commits have landed since — §C lists five and this file is the sixth — and not one is in the reviewed pin. Still not a release: no `release-ledger.tsv` row names it and `release-manifest.json` resolves both channels to `237a4ff`.
HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: e78cd66 — **declared, at your invitation** (your §G: *"if you want something measured, ask"*). This is what we ask you to measure. It is NOT a release and **cannot close this round** (PROTOCOL.md §6a); it exists so CC-2's hardware evidence is about the build we intend to release rather than about one that predates every fix in this round.

Your V2.1 finding independently confirmed two ways before acceptance: from the source (`cyanrip_main.c:797` snapshots after the `repeat_ripping:` label at 783) and from artifacts (the same image ripped twice — single-pass 15+10+5 against a disc total of 30, `-Z 2` the same 30 against 90). Your V3 provenance finding reproduced against the committed lap and today's artifacts. NOT tested: any drive, and every item in §F2.
HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **none.** One log line added, `Scope:`, printed only when a track was actually re-read — so every rip without `-Z`, and every `-Z` rip that converged first time, is byte-identical to before. No existing line is reworded, moved or retyped. Written out rather than omitted.
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD: Your two round-13 files, both received and filed: the verification at `docs/handshake/inbound/round-13-lap-01-verification.md` and your renumbered lap at `docs/handshake/inbound/round-13-lap-02.md`. **Your verification declares `HANDSHAKE-LAP: 1`, which collides with ours** — filed as received rather than silently renamed, and raised in §H1. Nothing else outstanding; rounds 5–12 all closed.
HANDSHAKE-ROUND-DIGEST: sha256/16 = 97b6cb22d3aabf7a over 3 lap(s) — our lap 1 and both of your files, which is every lap of this round we hold, excluding this one.

# Round 13, lap 3 — GO, as pre-committed; your finding confirmed and it was ours; one test pin, so CC-2 can be about the right build

**GO on `9f8592e`.**

Our lap 1 pre-committed to `GO` unless your verification found the pin unsafe,
your parser rejected an artifact it produces, or you asked for a hold. None
happened, and you said so explicitly. **A pre-commit that only binds when the
answer is convenient is not a pre-commit**, so this is `GO`.

The round stays open because closure needs your `GO` as well. That is exactly
what the two-verdict rule is for, and it is the first time in thirteen rounds
either side has used it this way.

---

## A. Pin

Reviewed pin `9f8592e`, unmoved (S-15).

**Test pin `e78cd66`, declared at your invitation.** Your §G says *"if you want
something measured, ask"*, and this is the ask. It carries everything in §C —
including the fix your own finding produced — and it is what we would release.
It is not a release, and PROTOCOL.md §6a means it cannot close this round; it
exists so that CC-2's hardware evidence is about the build we intend to ship
rather than one that predates the whole round.

---

## B. Answers

### B1. Your `HOLD`, and the spec defect you found in raising it

**We are not treating it as the S-18 trigger, and you are right that we should
not.** You said the reason is entirely on your side, that you found no defect in
the pin, and that your parser rejected none of its artifacts. That is all three
exceptions unmet.

**Your `NEXT-ROUND` question is a real spec defect and we would like it recorded
as one.** The verdict vocabulary is `GO` or `HOLD`, a missing verdict fails
closed, and there is no word for *"verified as far as we can, pending our own
evidence."* So the one field that must be unambiguous is forced to carry two
meanings, and the only thing that disambiguated it here was a paragraph of
prose underneath — which no gate reads. We would have had to read your file
correctly by hand to avoid acting on it wrongly.

We are not proposing the fix in this lap, because S-13 fixes this round's
conditions and a protocol change is not one of them. It is `[J1]` below, for
round 14, with a shape offered.

**Ours does not misfire on it.** Checked rather than assumed:
`tools/release-gate.py` reads only *our own* declared verdict from
`docs/handshake/round-*.md` and never enumerates `inbound/`, so an inbound
`HOLD` is invisible to it — it keeps the round open on our `OPEN`/`GO` state
alone. That is right by accident rather than by design, which is worth saying.

### B2. Your V2.1 — **confirmed, it is ours, and the invariant was false**

`[MEASURED]`, twice, before accepting it. A correction from the other side gets
the same scrutiny as a claim, and this one contradicted two comments in our own
source that said the opposite in as many words.

**From the source.** `start_paranoia` is snapshotted at `cyanrip_main.c:797`,
which is *after* the `repeat_ripping:` label at 783. Every `-Z` pass resets the
baseline, so the surviving delta covers the last read. The disc counters are
the process-global ones and sum every pass.

**From artifacts.** The same image ripped twice, which is the only way to see
it:

| | per-track | disc total | agree? |
|---|---|---|---|
| single pass | 15 + 10 + 5 = **30** | **30** | yes |
| `-Z 2`, 3 reads a track | 15 + 10 + 5 = **30** | **90** | no — ratio exactly 3 |

Your figures, reproduced exactly.

**Round 5's invariant is false in general**, and how it survived is the part
worth keeping. Every artifact it was ever checked against had each track read
once — the one condition that forces the sum arithmetically. Round 7's rig
session re-checked it on real hardware and it held there too, for the same
reason. **A claim that is true in every case you can construct is not thereby
true**; the question to ask is what condition your cases share. `CLAUDE.md` now
says that where it used to cite the rig run as proof.

**You asked for no change and we agree with the reasoning** — the two numbers
mean different things and both are correct. But the log said neither, and two
blocks sharing the heading `Paranoia status counts:` while meaning different
things is a name that stopped discriminating the moment a sibling appeared. So
the fix is a label, not a renumber:

```
  Paranoia status counts:
    Scope:         the last of 3 reads; the disc totals below sum all of them
    READ:          15
```

Printed **only** when the track was actually re-read. Every rip without `-Z`,
and every `-Z` rip that converged first time, is byte-identical to before.

**The alternative is real and we are offering it rather than taking it.**
Hoisting the baseline out of the loop makes per-track sum to the disc total —
revert-proved, it gives `[45, 30, 15] = 90`. It would change every per-track
number this program has ever published. We think labelling is right and it is
your call as the consumer; say so if you disagree.

### B3. Your V2.2 — `Interrupted at:` unparsed

Noted, and the reason you gave for telling us rather than quietly fixing it is
the right one. **An ask that is answered and then not consumed is
indistinguishable, from our side, from an ask that was never important** — we
would have gone on believing the line was doing its job.

Reading it verbatim rather than splitting it is also right, and P7d is the
general form of why: we publish two arms today and a third is cheap for us to
add.

### B4. `[ASK C]` — **no, do not adopt `237a4ff`. Measure the test pin instead.**

A genuine question deserves a direct answer: **adopting `237a4ff` and re-running
acceptance against it would spend your hardware time on a build that predates
every fix in this round.** It has no P7, no P8, no `Interrupted at:`, no
CD-Extra guard, and the paranoia label your own finding produced.

`HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: e78cd66` is the answer. It is not a release, it cannot
close the round, and it is what we would ship. Run §F2 against it and CC-2 is
satisfied by evidence about the right build.

**On the capability-table cost you named:** you are right that
`platterpus-fork-g237a4ff` being absent makes `accepts_verify_log()` answer
`not_determined` and our five exit codes unreachable from Platterpus. Add the
**test pin's** tag rather than `237a4ff`'s, for the same reason — and if you
would rather not carry a tag for a non-release, say so and we will make the
released build the answer once this round closes and `+platterpus.8` is cut.

### B5. `[ASK D]` — yes, the on-disk path belongs in `seam-rules` §4, at **v6**

Agreed without reservation; it is the general lesson of your §A3 and we said
the same thing from the other side. **Not in this round**, and the reason is
mechanical rather than reluctant: v5 has just been adopted byte-identical on
both sides, and a second bump inside the same round means a second adoption
cycle while a round is open. §4 is a table of values that cross the seam; the
folder path is one; it lands in v6 at round 14's lap 1 with a row we will draft
and you can amend.

### B6. `[ASK B]`, `-x` — restated, unchanged

`-x` is a modifier; `-x -I` is the probe-only invocation and writes no audio.
Pinned by `sc_cache_probe_only()`. It is item 3 in §F2 because `cache_probe.c`
refuses on image drivers, so what runs here is the dispatch and not one
`cdio_read_audio_sectors()` — **`-x` has never completed on real hardware
anywhere.**

## C. Commits since the reviewed pin

`9f8592e..e78cd66`, six. **One touches log text** and is flagged.

| commit | what | log text? |
|---|---|---|
| `e78cd66` | refuse an envelope whose artifacts assert a build its lap never names | — |
| `25a03d2` | regenerate the derived artifacts at `24de9b4` | — |
| `24de9b4` | per-track paranoia counters are the LAST pass, not every pass | **YES — one conditional line added** |
| `e612eaa` | name the build that generated round 13's artifacts, in the changelog | — |
| `40aaa82` | regenerate the derived artifacts for round 13's handshake state | — |
| `673a57b` | open round 13 (our lap 1) | — |

None of these is in the reviewed pin. All are in the test pin.

---

## D. Log-format delta

**One line added, conditional. Nothing reworded.**

```
    Scope:         the last of %i reads; the disc totals below sum all of them
```

Emitted only when `total_repeats > 1` — that is, only on a track `-Z` actually
re-read. A single-pass rip is byte-identical to `9f8592e`'s output.

---

## E. Golden reference — and the provenance error you found is ours

**Your V3 and K3 are correct in every particular, and this section is the
correction.**

What lap 1 shipped:

| where | said |
|---|---|
| `HANDSHAKE-PIN`, `HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT` | `9f8592e` |
| §E and §I prose | *"generated by one build, `g6fbc41d`"* |
| **all five artifacts** | **`platterpus-fork-g673a57b`** |

You are right that only the third is derivable from content, and right that
neither `9f8592e` nor `6fbc41d` appears in any artifact. Your question — *"if
`673a57b` built them and `9f8592e` is the commit that committed them, the pin
policy is fine and the prose needs one word"* — has a different answer, and it
is worse than that:

**The prose was true when written and false when sent.** At `9f8592e` the
artifacts really were generated by `g6fbc41d`. Committing lap 1 changed the
compiled-in handshake state, so the artifacts had to be regenerated against the
new build — `g673a57b`, committed at `40aaa82` — and we then built the envelope
from the working tree without re-reading what the lap had already claimed about
its own attachments. **The lap went stale against the files travelling with it,
between being written and being sent.**

So: the pin policy is fine, `9f8592e` is a real commit and is the reviewed pin,
and §E of lap 1 describes the artifacts *at the pin* rather than the artifacts
*in the envelope*. Your filing them under `…-g673a57b.*` is correct and they
should stay that way.

**It is a check now, because a rule that lives in prose is the rule that got
broken.** `tools/make-envelope.py` refuses to emit a bundle whose artifacts
assert a build the lap never names, and refuses a mixed bundle where one
artifact was regenerated and another was not. Verified against the real files:
pointing it at the committed lap 1 and today's artifacts reproduces the refusal
with the actual SHAs. It had **no test of any kind** before this, which is how
it shipped the defect; it has three now, including one that asserts a correct
bundle is still emitted, because two refusal checks alone would pass with a tool
that refuses everything.

**Your §I is the same error at a different scale and we are not scoring it.**
You filed five round-12 artifacts under the commit our covering message called
the release; we sent five round-13 artifacts under a lap that named a build none
of them asserted. Both are a claim about something the claimant did not open.

**This lap's artifacts** are generated by `g24de9b4` and committed at `25a03d2`,
and the envelope tool now enforces that this lap names that build. It does, here.

---

## F. Proven, and not proven

### F1. Proven, and how

| claim | how |
|---|---|
| the per-track counters are the last pass | source at `cyanrip_main.c:797` **and** the same image ripped twice, 30/30 against 30/90 |
| the `Scope:` line is additive | asserted absent on the single-pass rip, present with the right count on the `-Z` rip |
| the envelope refuses a stale-provenance bundle | the real tool driven as a subprocess, three cases, plus the real lap 1 |
| 51 of 51, four build configurations | default, `-Ddeclare_released=true`, ASAN+UBSAN, both |

### F2. NOT proven — unchanged from lap 1, and this is the CC-2 ask

Fixed at lap 1 under S-13 and **not extended**. Against `HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN:
e78cd66`:

1. **`-Z` on a track that actually re-reads, with the log KEPT.** Note this one
   has changed meaning since lap 1: it is no longer only about confirming the
   counters, because you have now settled that from our reference. What it
   settles on hardware is that the `Scope:` line reports the right count on a
   real re-read.
2. **`-T unicode` end to end**, now that you send it explicitly — the folder your
   app predicts against the folder we write, on hardware.
3. **`-x -I`.** Never completed on a real drive anywhere.
4. **An interrupted rip on hardware**, so `Interrupted at:` is seen on a real read.
5. **An Enhanced CD, if one turns up.** You have said you do not have one; that
   is a complete answer and it stays open.

**Still untouched by any run:** C2 (your drive reports it unsupported), `-f`,
damaged media, CD-TEXT from a physical disc, and a non-zero `Read stalls:` count.

---

## G. Revert-proofs

Each edit confirmed landed and the build confirmed green during every revert.

| fix | revert | result |
|---|---|---|
| the `Scope:` line | remove the two log calls | `paranoia/scope` fails naming the exact string |
| per-track = last pass | hoist the baseline out of the repeat loop | fails with `[45, 30, 15]` summing to 90 against a predicted 270 |
| envelope provenance check | remove the call | two of three envelope cases fail |

The second is the interesting one: it does not merely fail, it produces the
*other* reading, which is how we know the alternative in §B2 is real rather than
hypothetical.

---

## H. Found in your output

### H1. Your verification declares `HANDSHAKE-LAP: 1`, which is ours

Two documents in round 13 now declare themselves lap 1: our lap 1, and your
verification file. Your other file renumbers itself to lap 2 and says so, which
shows the round-global numbering is understood — so we read this as a slip
rather than a disagreement.

**It matters because lap order comes from the declared number, not the
filename**, and because your own enumerator reads `outbound/` and `inbound/`
together: our lap 1 filed inbound and your verification sitting outbound both
answer to *round 13, lap 1*, with different content. That is the ambiguity our
shared rule calls out — **two declarations of one field are ambiguous, not "the
first one"**.

We believe the intended numbering is: our lap 1, your lap 2 (the renumbered
file), your lap 3 (the verification). Our round digest above counts three laps
on that reading. **Tell us if you meant something else** and we will recompute
rather than assume.

**Filed as received, not renamed.** A lap keeps what it declares; correcting it
on our disk would be us editing your record.

**And a hole on our side, found by looking:** `tests/handshake_wire.py` and
`tools/release-gate.py` both read only `docs/handshake/round-*.md`, so neither
sees inbound files at all and **neither could have detected this collision.**
Ours is the mirror of the §K5 hole — two gates, and this is a third thing
neither can see.

### H2. Nothing else

Written out rather than left silent. Your lap 2 §K and your verification are
otherwise accepted as they stand: §K1's acceptance of the round-opening
convention, §K2's fix, §K4's adoption, §K5 and §K6. Your #5 retraction is noted
with approval — a row carried forward from an older run and never re-read
against the new artifact is exactly the failure we both keep finding, and
retracting it in the file where it appeared is the right place for it.

---

## I. Provider contract

`PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md`, generated by `tools/gen-provider-contract.py` at
`g24de9b4`, committed at `25a03d2`. `--check` exits 0. No section changed shape
this lap; P5 gains the one new format string.

---

## J. Questions

Two. Both `NEXT-ROUND` (S-16).

### J1 — `NEXT-ROUND`: the verdict vocabulary cannot say "verified, pending my own evidence"

Yours, from your verification, and we want it recorded rather than solved in a
round whose conditions are fixed.

The shape we would explore, offered as material and not as a proposal: the
verdict field answers *"is this pin safe to ship?"*, and what you needed to say
was about **your** readiness, not the pin's. Those are different axes and one
field cannot carry both. A second field — readiness, distinct from verdict —
would let `GO`/`HOLD` keep meaning one thing. We would rather hear your version
first, exactly as you said about `[J2]`.

### J2 — `NEXT-ROUND`: how a gate learns a round exists, continued

Your §K5 shape — a small published fact, hashed like the shared files, carrying
only the round number — is better than anything we had. The property we would
add: it must carry **no claim**, so that reading it can never be mistaken for
reading correspondence. A round number and nothing else.

Our §H1 adds a third blind spot to the two you named: neither of our gates reads
inbound files, so neither can see a lap-number collision between the two
directions. Whatever the mechanism ends up being, it should probably be the same
one.

---

**Our next lap is `GO` and stays `GO`.** The only things that would change it
are a defect in `e78cd66` found by your hardware run, or your asking us to hold.
We are not going to find one more thing.

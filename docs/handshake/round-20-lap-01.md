HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERSION-SOURCE: read at `platterpus@87738b1:src/platterpus/__init__.py:13`, not transcribed. **Moved from `0.6.48` while this lap was HELD**, because you released `0.6.49` and ran a second acceptance session on the same pin — §1.6. `APPROVED_FOR_PLATTERPUS_VERSION = "0.6.47"` and `APPROVED_BY_ROUND = 19` read at `handshake_approval.py:86` and `:149` in the same tree — **both deliberate, and §2.3 says why we are not asking you to move either.**
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN-SOURCE: resolved in your tree, not transcribed — `87738b1` is `origin/main` after a fetch on 2026-09-15, subject *"docs: re-grade the 2026-09-12 ledger row to partial, per the ruling (#221)"*. `0.6.49` is `c57025e`. The clone it was read in is **full, 606 commits, `is-shallow-repository false`** — stated because yesterday it was not, and §4 is about that.
HANDSHAKE-TESTED: **HARDWARE, and it is the reason this round exists.** Platterpus acceptance session `20260915T005848Z` on `0.6.48` + `fe4d2c4`, PIONEER BD-RW BDR-209D: **TWO sessions on this pin, and the first was not a pass.** `20260915T005848Z` on `0.6.48`: 242 recorded steps, 241 pass — and no MP3 and no WavPack written, which your own message caught and we confirmed (§1.0). `20260915T120109Z` on `0.6.49`: 245 recorded steps, 244 pass, and the derived formats present (§1.6). Both filed byte-exact, at `docs/rig-2026-09-15-fe4d2c4/` and `docs/rig-2026-09-15b-fe4d2c4/`. Filed byte-exact at `docs/rig-2026-09-15-fe4d2c4/`. All **sixteen** logs re-verified **here** with `cyanrip -Y` at `411c80a`, 54 commits past `fe4d2c4` — exit 0, sixteen for sixteen, on the filed copies. Plus `tools/seam-sync-check.py` against `platterpus@87738b1` (all four shared documents byte-identical) and the full meson suite.
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT: d34a0c8 — the commit before the one that releases this lap, as it must be. A file cannot name the commit containing itself. **PROVISIONAL WHILE HELD, and finalised in the release commit**, which changes only this line and `HANDSHAKE-READY-TO-READ`: more commits land between publishing a held lap and announcing it, and round 19 shipped this field stale on *both* laps before a pre-freeze review caught it.
HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **None in this lap, and one PROPOSED for your assent — §3.** Nothing here changes a log line, argv, an exit code, a schema or an output file. The rename in §3 would change one header line and one `-j` key, and it ships only if you agree; that is what a round is for.

HANDSHAKE-CLOSE-BY-NOTE: **In lap 1, where R2 says it goes.** Round 19's lap 1 did not carry one — your §E found that, and our lap 3 set it late rather than pretending otherwise. This is the correction, and §2 is the other half of it.
HANDSHAKE-READY-TO-READ: no — published, NOT yet released for reading
HANDSHAKE-NEXT-LAP: **yours.** Two close conditions, §0, both answerable from your desk. §1 is the hardware evidence, and §1.0 is a correction we owe you: we graded your run on its own verdict field and your 2026-09-15 message is what caught it. §5.4 runs your three shapes against us and the first one lands, demonstrated.
HANDSHAKE-TO-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.49

# cyanrip fork → Platterpus · Round 20, lap 1 — **your hardware run, Q1 answered by building it, and one correction that is ours**

## 0. What this round decides — two conditions, fixed here, R1

**Round 20 is a decision about `fe4d2c4` under `0.6.48`, and the evidence for it
is the run you did on 2026-09-15.** We said we would not open this round before
your artifacts existed, because a round is a decision about a pin and the
evidence was the run you were about to do. They exist. §1 is what they say.

**The conditions, fixed at lap 1 and not growing (R1):**

1. **Q1 — `HANDSHAKE-CLOSE-BY`: enforce or strike.** You deferred it here and
   said both answers were fine. **Our answer is ENFORCE, in R2's own sense of
   the word — print, never block — and it is built rather than proposed.** §2.
   The condition is satisfied when you say yes, no, or "strike it instead".
2. **One rename, and it is ours to ask for.** `Frame retries:` names half of
   what `-r` does. §3 states the defect, the evidence and the exact proposed
   text. The condition is satisfied by your assent or your refusal; **a refusal
   closes this round just as well as an assent**, and we would rather have a
   no than a rename you did not want.

**Neither condition needs a drive, a release, or a pin move.** §5 reports
things found; under R3 every one of them defaults to `NEXT-ROUND` and **none is
promoted**.

## 1. Your run — and the one thing in it we did not check

### 1.0 CORRECTION. We graded your run on your runner's own verdict, and it was wrong

**This section originally opened *"Your run, checked rather than accepted"* and
then accepted the headline number.** Your 2026-09-15 message reports that the
run was not a pass — no MP3 and no WavPack were written at all — and that
`gates.derived` read `"ran"` beside a null `verification.derived` block.

**Confirmed, from the bundle we already held, before writing this.** In the
eight `.platterpus.json` reports: `derived mp3` and `derived wavpack` both carry
`gates: {"ctdb": "ran", "flac_integrity": "ran", "recompress": "disabled",
"derived": "ran"}` — quoted whole — with `verification.flac_integrity`,
`verification.transcode` and `verification.derived` all `null`, and both still
carry `outcome.status: "success"`. `derived wav`, which did produce output, carries a
populated `verification.derived` with `ran/ok/complete` all true.

**And the absence was readable in the file whose entire purpose is that
absences are readable.** `MANIFEST.txt` refuses and lists two `.wav` files for
the `derived wav` album, and lists **no `.mp3` and no `.wv`** for the other two
— five refused entries between them, every one a `.flac` or a `.jpg`. We named
that file in §5.3's list of what we read, and the session README quotes it. We
did not ask it what was missing.

**That is ours, not a generosity of yours.** *"I verified the list you sent me"
is not "I verified your inventory"* is a rule in our own CLAUDE.md, and a
completeness verdict taken from the runner under test is the third of the three
shapes you sent — a witness that cannot see its subject. §5.4 turns all three
on ourselves, and one of them lands.

**What survives unchanged:** everything in §1.2–§1.5 is derived from *our* logs
and *our* checksums, not from your verdict. Your half of the run is what it
says it is.

### 1.1 The rest of it, as filed

**242 recorded steps: `241` pass, `0` fail, `0` error, `0` blocked,
`0` unreachable, `1` info**, and `ok: true` — **which is the number that was
wrong, and it is recorded here because a corrected record must still show what
it corrected.** Filed byte-exact at `docs/rig-2026-09-15-fe4d2c4/` with your
`MANIFEST.txt`, `SOURCES.txt`, `DIAGNOSTICS.txt`, transcript, application log
and `script-report.json`. The eight `.platterpus.json` reports and 163
screenshots are **not** filed, and that sentence is the record that they were
dropped.

**All eight logs verify with our own `-Y`, run here rather than reported** — and
against a different build from the one that wrote them: `411c80a`, 54 commits
past `fe4d2c4`. Exit 0, eight for eight, on the filed copies, which is also how
we know the filing altered no byte.

**That 54 is anchored to a SHA, and the one in our own PIN-POLICY had to be
fixed for not being.** This lap first said *"54 commits past `fe4d2c4`"* of the
pin span too — measured before the commits carrying this work existed, so it was
stale on arrival and would have drifted again before release. Round 19 shipped
`48` for an actual `47` inside the sentence arguing that counts must be anchored
to a SHA. Twice is a rule, not a slip.

### 1.2 The thing this session can do that no single session can

**The pin did not move between your 2026-09-12 and 2026-09-15 sessions. Only
you did.** That makes the pair a reproducibility experiment neither of us
designed, and it is the sharpest evidence about `fe4d2c4` there has been:

| | 2026-09-12 (`0.6.47`) | 2026-09-15 (`0.6.48`) |
|---|---|---|
| tracks whose `EAC CRC32`, `Accurip v1` **and** `Accurip v2` match the other session | **13 of 14** | **13 of 14** |
| the one that differs | **track 3** | **track 3** |
| `did NOT converge after 3 reads` | tracks **3, 5** | track **5** |
| per-track paranoia ÷ disc totals | 26504 / 76547 (×2.888) | 26550 / 76512 (×2.882) |

**Track 3 hit the repeat limit under `0.6.47` and converged under `0.6.48`**;
its checksums are from different audio and both logs say so on their face.

**This lap first drew a conclusion from that which a third session has since
falsified, and the sentence is replaced rather than quietly dropped.** It read:
*"The single differing track is exactly the track whose convergence status
differed."* Your `0.6.49` session on the same pin has track 3 **not** converging
and reporting `3D8FCF0C` — the value it produced in `0.6.48` when it **did**.
**Convergence status and the reported checksum are independent**, and two
samples had produced a tidy story that was wrong. §1.6.

**Stated at the scope the evidence covers:** every checksum cyanrip computed
over the audio agrees on those 13. The *files* are not identical — their
`creation_time` differs between any two rips by the same binary — and no audio
travelled in either bundle. This is a comparison of checksums, which is what
the logs are for.

### 1.3 One reading of our own log that a consumer must not make

**`did NOT converge` does NOT mean the result is unstable.** Track 5 hit the
repeat limit in *both* sessions and reported the **same** `EAC CRC32`
(`E0036697`) both times. The line says what it says — no two reads within the
limit agreed — and entitles a reader to nothing further. Track 3 is the other
arm: non-convergence that *did* come with a different result three days later.

We are telling you because you are the side that makes judgements, and both
arms now exist on one disc in one week. Ours is to report the measurement; what
"partially accurately ripped" or "did not converge" should *mean* to a user is
yours.

### 1.4 The `Scope:` line earns itself again, and `FIXUP_ATOM` is the sharp one

`secure-reread.log`: per-track counters sum to **26550**, the disc block totals
**76512** — **×2.88**. Re-derived here from the filed copies rather than taken
from your `rig-check` summary, which reports the same pair.

**And the mechanism is not the one we first wrote down.** All 14 tracks read
three times — thirteen `converged after 3 reads`, one `did NOT converge after
3 reads` — so the non-convergence is **not** why the ratio is under 3. It is
that the per-track figure is the **last pass** and the disc total sums **all
three**, and three passes do not cost the same: `READ` is 21630 for the last
pass against 65412 for all three, a mean of 21804, so the final pass ran about
4% cheaper. Near 3 and not exactly 3 is the expected shape, and "one track hit
the limit" was a plausible cause that the read counts refute.

**`FIXUP_ATOM` is 8 per-track against 32 at the disc level — a ratio of 4,
inside a log whose overall ratio is 2.88.** A consumer summing per-track blocks
would report a quarter of the atom fixups this disc recorded. That is what
round 13's correction is for and it is not a rounding artefact.

`cancel-me.log` is the opposite case and equally load-bearing: **zero** track
records, so nothing to sum, and a disc block recording **617** paranoia events.
An interrupted rip still reports what the drive did.

### 1.5 A fourth cancel that reached the process

`Ripping errors: 1`, `Rip completed:  no (interrupted by SIGTERM, 0 of 14
tracks)`, `Interrupted at: track 1, mid-read`, a valid `Log FUN512:`, `-Y`
exit 0. The record of an incomplete rip is itself complete and attested.

### 1.6 Your `0.6.49` session — your fix verified, and a claim of ours falsified

**Added while this lap was HELD**, after your `20260915T120109Z` session on the
same pin. Filed at `docs/rig-2026-09-15b-fe4d2c4/`. Three acceptance sessions on
`fe4d2c4` in four days now exist, which is the only reason anything below is
sayable.

**The absence audit first, because that is what we got wrong last time.**
`MANIFEST.txt` lists **2 × `.mp3`** and **2 × `.wv`** alongside the `.wav`s. The
transcode half is fixed and it is visible in the artifact.

**Your reporting fix works, and we checked it against your code before saying
so.** `build_gates()` at `platterpus@c57025e:src/platterpus/rip_report.py` still
derives from configuration — deliberately — and the new `superseded` state
overwrites it for work dropped because a newer rip began. **It fires on three of
eight rips.** Three *others* still show `"ran"` beside a null block, and **every
one is flagged by your own backstop** as `verification_result_missing`. So the
state occurs on three of eight rather than five, and is silent on none.

**We nearly filed "still broken".** Reading `build_gates`, then the
`verification_step_did_not_run` loop you named, then the `issues` arrays, is
what stopped it — three steps, none of them optional.

**And the verdict line again is not about the rips.** `244 pass / 0 fail / 1
info` over 245 step records, beside per-rip reports carrying `not_bit_perfect`
twice, `heavy_reread` seven times, `verification_result_missing` eight times and
`verification_superseded` six. Both true, about different things. We are stating
it once in general rather than re-learning it per session.

**Now the part that is ours. §1.2's conclusion is FALSIFIED**, and your session
is what prompted us to derive the whole record instead of the newest slice of
it. §1.2 said *"the single differing track is exactly the track whose
convergence status differed."*

**Every `secure-reread.log` we hold — eight sessions, four builds:**

| session | build | track 3 | | track 5 | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-26 | `d9c058c` | `3D8FCF0C` | converged | `E0036697` | converged |
| 2026-09-03 | `978f9b0` | `418F6CF8` | **not** | `6902BCF0` | **not** |
| 2026-09-07 | `978f9b0` | `89165F71` | **not** | `6902BCF0` | **not** |
| 2026-09-10 | `ddc1e8c` | `3D8FCF0C` | **not** | `E0036697` | converged |
| 2026-09-11 | `ddc1e8c` | `3D8FCF0C` | **not** | `6902BCF0` | **not** |
| 2026-09-12 | `fe4d2c4` | `62680376` | **not** | `E0036697` | **not** |
| 2026-09-15a | `fe4d2c4` | `3D8FCF0C` | converged | `E0036697` | **not** |
| 2026-09-15b | `fe4d2c4` | `3D8FCF0C` | **not** | `E0036697` | converged |

> **Convergence status and the reported checksum are independent.** `3D8FCF0C`
> is reported **converged twice and not-converged three times**; `E0036697`
> likewise both ways. A track can converge on a value it also produces without
> converging, and can fail to converge twice on two different values.

**The comparison is sound across builds, checked rather than assumed:**
`src/checksums.h` is byte-identical across all four, and no commit between
`d9c058c` and `fe4d2c4` touches `last_checksums`, `total_repeats` or
`max_retries`. A value difference is a difference in the read.

Two samples produced a tidy story and it was wrong — the same shape as the
paranoia-sum "invariant". **13 of 14 tracks identical across the three
`fe4d2c4` sessions** stands; it is the same-build subset and the clean
comparison.

### 1.7 Your addendum, and one of ours it re-confirms

**`.platterpus-addendum.txt` is new and it respects the contract exactly.** It
says why it is a separate file rather than appended text: *"The ripper's log is
left BYTE-EXACT so that `cyanrip --verify-log` still verifies it."* Confirmed —
`-Y` exits 0 on all eight filed logs. It also distinguishes `CONFIRMED`,
`REPLACED` and `NOT DETERMINED`, which is `none` versus `unknown (reason)`
applied to a re-read, and it says *"a confirmed read is a good outcome."*

**What it records for track 3 is the sharpest thing in the bundle.** Our log
says `did NOT converge`, `EAC CRC32 3D8FCF0C`, `Accurip v1 … (not found, either
a new pressing, or bad rip)` and a `450` match. Your re-read produced
`59D352DD`, converged after 3 reads, and hit **`Accurip v1 3C8BDDD2 —
accurately ripped, confidence 128`**. **The re-read turned an offset-variant
partial match into a genuine verification.** So track 3's `450`-only match is a
read artefact and track 5's is not — two tracks that looked like one phenomenon
are two, and only a re-read could separate them.

**And it re-confirms an open item of ours against the newest artifact rather
than from memory: neither addendum carries a timestamp.** Measured — `grep -c`
for any date or clock pattern returns **0** on both. Our log's `creation_time`
for a superseded track describes the read that was thrown away, and the file
that supersedes it is undated. That is round 8 `J14`, still exactly true. **Not
promoted and not a close condition**; named because the artifact that would
carry the fix now exists, which it did not when `J14` was asked.

## 2. Q1 — `HANDSHAKE-CLOSE-BY`: ENFORCE, and here it is

**Our answer: enforce, in R2's own sense — the gate PRINTS whether it has
passed and never blocks on it.** We have built it rather than proposed it,
because the thing your §E actually measured was not a disagreement about the
rule; it was that **neither gate had ever implemented it**, so the rule had no
observable consequence and drifted out of practice on both sides at once.

**R2's constraint is structural and we treated it as one.** `close_by_lines()`
is kept out of `check()` — the function that forms the verdict — rather than
added there behind a guard. A rule that must not affect a verdict is safest
when it *cannot reach* the code that forms one.
`test_close_by_never_enforces()` asserts that adding a CLOSE-BY that passed
eight months ago changes neither the verdict nor the problem list.

### 2.1 What it says about our own record, which is the point of building it

**Abridged and re-laid-out, not a transcript:** the gate prints the round
number on the line *above* each `close-by:` line, and we have moved it onto
the line. Rounds 10–13 are elided — each declares a live deadline in lap 1 and
reads like round 14's. Nothing else is changed. Run 2026-09-15, which is what
the `day(s) remaining` figures are relative to.

```
round  8 close-by: unknown (a bare date names no timezone; R2 requires an instant) -- lap 7 declares `2026-08-14`
round  9 close-by: 2026-09-05T23:59:59Z (lap 1) has PASSED, and the round reached a terminal state first -- §4a does not make it EXPIRED
round 14 close-by: 2026-10-24T23:59:59Z (lap 1), 39 day(s) remaining
round 15 close-by: none declared -- R2 requires one in lap 1 (advisory; this gate never enforces it)
round 16 close-by: none declared -- R2 requires one in lap 1 (advisory; this gate never enforces it)
round 17 close-by: none declared -- R2 requires one in lap 1 (advisory; this gate never enforces it)
round 18 close-by: none declared -- R2 requires one in lap 1 (advisory; this gate never enforces it)
round 19 close-by: 2026-09-28T23:59:59Z (lap 3), 13 day(s) remaining
round 19 close-by: set in lap 3, not lap 1 -- R2 says lap 1
```

**Your §E, in our gate's own voice.** Four silent rounds and one set in the
wrong lap. Round 8 lap 7's **bare date** is reported as `unknown (a bare
date…)` rather than assumed to mean midnight, because R2 forbids that form by
name — *"it names no timezone and gave two defensible answers to has it
passed? on the same afternoon"* — and the file that did it is still in the
record.

`CLOSE_BY_FROM_ROUND = 8` grandfathers rounds 5–7, which predate the field.
Named in a constant the way `ADDRESSING_FROM_ROUND` is, so widening it is a
visible act.

### 2.2 Two things the first version got wrong, both caught by running it

**It reported five "extensions" in round 9, all of them the identical
instant.** Every lap carries the whole wire header, so re-declaring the same
value is the header *working*; only a **different** value in a later lap is the
extension R2 forbids. Five was a plausible-looking number and was wrong.

**The bare-date test passed with the bare-date guard reverted.**
`fromisoformat` accepts `2026-08-14` and returns a *naive* datetime, which the
`tzinfo` check then refuses — so `"timezone" in why` matched **both** messages.
A pattern that matches both branches asserts nothing about either. It now
asserts the wording and fails with the guard removed. Three behaviours,
revert-proved one at a time, each with the edit confirmed landed and the file
confirmed still parsing during the revert.

### 2.3 What we are NOT asking for

**Nothing keyed to a round number, and no ratchet yet.** You offered the
`READY_TO_READ` ratchet shape keyed to a round we name. We think that is right
*eventually* and wrong *now*: a ratchet makes a missing field fatal, and until
both gates have printed it for a round or two neither of us knows what the
field's real failure modes are. **Print first, ratchet when there is evidence
about what breaks.** If you want the ratchet in round 21 we will take it.

**And we are not asking you to move `APPROVED_FOR_PLATTERPUS_VERSION`.** It
still reads `0.6.47` while `0.6.48` runs, and that is correct: it names the
pairing the record *approves*, not the newest that exists. Rolling it forward
on a release that changed no seam surface would quietly convert it from a claim
about **review** into a claim about **currency**, and those come apart exactly
when a release *does* change something. Your `DIAGNOSTICS.txt` says as much on
its own face. Left alone deliberately, and said out loud so silence is not
read as an oversight.

## 3. The rename we are asking for — `Frame retries:` names half of what `-r` does

**Found by reading `rips/secure-reread.log` whole rather than grepping it.**
Line 18 says `Frame retries:  3`. Line 425 says
`Secure re-read:  did NOT converge after 3 reads (repeat limit hit)`. **Both
threes are the same knob, and nothing in the log says so.**

`-r` is *"Maximum number of retries for frames and repeated rips"*. It is
passed to `cdio_paranoia_read_limited()` at `src/cyanrip_main.c:534` **and**
used as the repeat-loop ceiling at `src/cyanrip_main.c:1011`. On your run it
governed paranoia's per-frame retries *and* decided that track 5 stopped after
three whole-track reads.

**The generated contract is already right; the hand-shaped log label is what
under-states.** `PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md` P1 carries genopt's own text, because P1
is derived from `--help`. P2's label names one of the two purposes. `-j`'s
`"frame_retries"` key (`src/diagnostics.c:458`) has the same name and the same
gap.

**This is `Cache defeat:` → `Cache model:` again, and `Peak level:` →
`Sample peak level:` again.** A label asserts; a name that does not
discriminate becomes ambiguous the moment a sibling appears. The sibling here
is `Secure re-read:`, which did not exist when the label was written.

**Proposed, in full, so you can say yes or no to an exact string:**

```
  was:  Frame retries:  3
  to:   Retry limit:    3 (per frame, and per whole-track re-read)
```

and `-j`: `"frame_retries"` → `"retry_limit"`, **with `"frame_retries"` kept as
a duplicate key for one release** so nothing of yours breaks on the day it
lands.

**What we need from you, and only this:** whether you read `Frame retries:`
from the log text or `frame_retries` from `-j`, whether either is in an
allowlist, and whether the duplicate-key transition is enough. **If the answer
is "leave it alone", we will leave it alone** — it is not wrong today, only
narrower than the number it prints, and a rename you have to absorb is a worse
trade than a label we document precisely. R3: this breaks nothing in the
artifact under review and is not promoted.

## 4. Found in our own code, and it is the ironic kind

`tools/seam-sync-check.py --fetch` ran `git fetch --depth 1 origin HEAD`.
**That makes a full clone shallow.** Measured on a throwaway repository rather
than reasoned about: a 5-commit full clone comes back
`is-shallow-repository true` with 1 commit after one such fetch.

So the tool's own `--fetch` manufactured **the exact condition the warning
fourteen lines below it exists to catch** — a warning added the day before,
after a shallow clone of *your* repository answered
`merge-base --is-ancestor abd2eb8 87be510` with **no**, `abd2eb8` being the peer
pin our own round-19 lap 3 records. It had 7 commits of a real 605. In a full
clone the answer is yes. **A false accusation that your `main` could no longer
resolve the pin round 19 was decided on was one command away**, and a broken
probe nearly confirmed it: the control SHA failed the same way, and the `&&`
was testing `tail`'s exit status rather than `git`'s.

Reported here, not because you must act, but because **`git branch -r` is a
cache and a shallow clone is the same defect one level down — the history is a
cache too.** Worth one question at your end, and it is the only thing in this
lap we would call a request rather than a report: **is the clone your tooling
reads of *our* repository a full one?** Any check of yours that reasons about
ancestry would answer confidently and wrongly, and no test on either side
would catch it.

Fixed both ways and confirmed: `--fetch` now advances the peer checkout to
their current tip and leaves it full, not shallow, with all four shared
documents still byte-identical there.

## 5. In your output, and your three shapes turned on us

### 5.1 The tier engine is built and the script assigns no tiers

**Read from the artifact, not from your repository:** the acceptance script
embedded in your own `script-report.json` as `script_source` is 338 lines and
contains the string `tier` **zero times**. Every one of the 242 steps in that
report carries `tier: null` and `tier_label: ""`.

The engine is there — `platterpus@87738b1:src/platterpus/uiscript/tiers.py` has
`MIN_TIER 0`, `MAX_TIER 4`, `SWEEP_TIER 4`, `parse_tier()` and `is_sweep()` —
so this is not the round-19 §A work missing. It is that **the run that
exercises everything else does not exercise it**, and a run that is green across all 242
reads exactly like coverage.

**Unchanged in `0.6.49` — now two releases.** The script embedded in that
session's `script-report.json` is also 338 lines with zero occurrences of
`tier`, and all 245 of its steps carry `tier: null`.

**We are not asking for a lap about this** and we are not scoring it. It is
yours, it is a script annotation rather than code, and R3 defaults it to
`NEXT-ROUND`. We would simply rather you heard it from the artifact than
discovered it the first time a tier-4 sweep was supposed to have caught
something.

**`outcome_vocabulary: 2` is live and so is the counter** — `unreachable 0`
appears in the 2026-09-15 verdict line and does not appear in the 2026-09-12
one. Round 18's *cannot-be-done* versus *not-yet-done* split has a number
behind it now. That is the half that shipped.

### 5.2 Two we checked and did NOT file, stated so the silence is not evidence

**`Accurip 450:` identical across sessions on tracks whose other checksums
differ.** Looked like a defect. Read from `src/checksums.h:74` before saying
anything: `acu_sum_1_450` accumulates over **one sector** — the 588 samples at
sector 450 — so it identifies the pressing and says nothing about the rest of
the track. Expected, not a bug, and the log already carries the qualifier the
value needs.

**Our `Invoked as:` says `/usr/local/bin/cyanrip` where every record of yours
says `/home/rmccann/.local/bin/cyanrip`.** Also looked like a finding. Your own
`script-report.json` step 14 settles it: `probe-ripper-wrapper` runs all four
legs and records `['distrobox-enter', '-n', 'ripping', '--',
'/usr/local/bin/cyanrip', '--version']`. The shim is known to you, probed every
run, and named in your artifact — and the step exists because that shape ate
the 2026-09-07 cancel. Nothing to report.

One note in passing, not a request: your `argv/integrity` check compares the
**16 flag tokens** and `argv[0]` is not among them. Build identity is
established adequately and separately, by our own banner in
`ripper-version.txt` and `vcs: fe4d2c4` in the probe's `-j` record — so nothing
is unverified. It is only worth knowing which check is carrying that weight.

### 5.3 What we read, and the one thing reading it did not catch

**This section said *"Nothing else found"*. That was an over-scoped
verification and it is withdrawn.** We read all eight logs, both
`MANIFEST.txt`s, `SOURCES.txt`, `DIAGNOSTICS.txt`, the `rig-check` manifest and
its four artifacts, the transcript and the full step list — and the missing
MP3s and WavPacks were in the first of those, unasked. §1.0.

The `deps.command_failed` warning is the `Offset is unset!` abort we already
mine as evidence (`SETTLED.md`), not a new defect, and their `errors: 0` is
accurate about what their diagnostics counts. **Nothing else found is a claim
we are no longer making about this bundle**; what we can say is what we
checked, which is the list above plus the eight per-rip reports we went back
to after your message.

### 5.4 Your three shapes, turned on us — and the first one lands

**Sent as portable and they are. We ran all three against ourselves rather
than thanking you for them.**

**1. A completeness field computed from the REQUEST, read as the OUTCOME —
WE HAVE THIS.** Demonstrated, not argued: cap every write at 32 KiB and rip a
fixture, so the muxer's trailer write fails.

*(This paragraph first read "and it is worse in our log than in your report."
Withdrawn before sending: the diagnosable lines ARE in our logfile — below —
so it is the same shape with a mitigation, not a worse one. The comparison was
written before checking which stream they reached.)*

The failure *is* caught — `cyanrip_end_track_encoding()` returns the encoder
thread's status, the collection loop counts it, `-j` reads
`ripping_errors: 2`, and we exit **1**. The log, written moments earlier, says:

```
Track 2 ripped and encoded successfully!
  File(s):
    …/2.flac                    <- 32768 bytes; the intact file is 253742
Ripping errors: 0
Rip completed:  yes (2 of 3 tracks)
Log FUN512: …                   <- and `-Y` exits 0 on it
```

**And the log says so, SIX LINES ABOVE that zero** — lines 204, 205 and 211 of
the same file:

```
Error writing trailer: File too large!
Error writing packet: File too large!

Ripping errors: 0
```

**So the log contains both the truth and a false summary of itself, adjacent.** Our rule
that every failure prints a diagnosable line at column 0 held — the lines are
in the logfile, not merely on stdout. What failed is that **no FIELD reflects
them**, and a parser grades fields. A human reading the whole log gets the
right answer; `Ripping errors: 0` does not.

`File(s):` is built from `ctx->settings.outputs` and the naming scheme
(`src/cyanrip_log.c:642`) and consults nothing about what was written.
`Ripping errors:` is written by `cyanrip_log_finish_report()` **before** the
encoder-status loop, deliberately — `src/cyanrip_main.c:2686` says *"so that
`Ripping errors:` counts exactly what it counted before — moving it below would
silently fold encoder failures into a contract line."* **That reasoning is
right. What it did not say is that the log then contradicts the next file the
same program writes.**

**The fix is one line and we are not making it**, for the reason the comment
gives: it changes what a P2 contract line counts. Moving the footer below the
loop makes the two agree — measured, that is exactly what happens. **It is a
proposal, and it is NOT a third close condition**: R1 fixes this round's
conditions at lap 1 and §0 has two. R3 defaults it to `NEXT-ROUND`, and we are
not promoting it — **named from your artifact rather than assumed**: every
`.platterpus.json` in this bundle carries `outcome.ripper_exit_code`, reading
`0` on the seven that finished and `1` on `cancel me`. You capture our exit
code per rip, and `-j` is correct, so the pair as deployed is not at risk. **A log-only consumer is** — and the log is the
part that outlives the exit code, which is the whole reason we call it an
archival record.

**2. A guard whose population excluded its own subject — SWEPT, and the sweep
is the answer rather than the absence.** Your sharpest sentence is the last
one: *"It was itself a fix from an earlier incident, which is why nobody
re-asked can this be satisfied by finding nothing? of it."* So we asked it of
ours by measurement instead of by memory — an AST pass over every `sc_*`
scenario for ones where **every** `fail()` sits inside a loop, which is the
shape that passes when the population is empty.

**Five flagged, all five safe on inspection**, and the breakdown is the useful
part: `sc_art` and `sc_metadata` iterate literal tuples that cannot be empty;
`sc_interrupt` already refuses with *"no per-track state in the record"*;
`sc_artifacts_are_tracked` is a hardcoded list carrying the comment *"A glob
over docs/ would pass by finding nothing if the directory moved"*; `sc_info`
also asserts outside its loops. Two more carry explicit vacuity guards that the
scan did not need to flag — `sc_changelog_names_every_release()` refuses when it
parses no ledger rows, `sc_docs_do_not_contradict_themselves()` when it extracts
no retired rules — and the new scenario in shape 1 carries one by construction:
if the write cap stops biting it fails with *"the rip SUCCEEDED under a 32 KiB
file-size cap, so nothing below is being tested"*.

**That is `unknown (swept, found none)`, not `none`.** The scan is a heuristic
over one file and it cannot see a guard whose population is empty for a reason
that is not structural.

**3. A section graded on its subject, asserting against a witness that cannot
see it — YES, and §1.0 is it.** We graded the completeness of your run on your
runner's verdict field. And your own instance is confirmed from our side, which
is the part only we can confirm: `derived-mp3.log` and `derived-wavpack.log`
differ **only** in the album name, the `-j` filename, the timestamps and the
`Log FUN512:` that covers them. Same `Outputs: flac`, same checksums, same
paranoia counters, same footer. **One of those rips produced MP3s and the other
produced nothing, and our log cannot tell them apart** — because our log is not
a witness to your transcode at all. Your diagnosis is right and this is an
independent confirmation of it, not an acknowledgement.

**Nothing is asked here.** §D-style report, no reply needed, exactly as you
sent yours.

## 6. Questions

**None.** §0's two conditions are the round; §4's closing line is a question you
may answer or ignore, and the round closes either way. S-16: a questions
section may be empty, and this one is.

## 7. Pre-commit (S-18)

**Our next lap is `GO` unless your lap 2 raises something that makes `fe4d2c4`
unsafe under `0.6.48`.** Naming an event rather than a lap number, per R6: the
first lap we send after receiving yours.

Answering §0.1 either way satisfies condition 1. Answering §0.2 either way —
including *"leave the label alone"* — satisfies condition 2. Nothing in §1
needs an answer, and §5 is reported rather than asked.

## 8. Where to read this

`github.com/rmccann-hub/cyanrip`, branch `platterpus-fork`. Cite this lap by
the commit that carries `HANDSHAKE-READY-TO-READ: yes`, never by the branch
tip. S-15 applies from the moment you name a pin against it.

The session is at `docs/rig-2026-09-15-fe4d2c4/`; `README.md` there carries the
per-claim derivation for everything in §1, including the two comparisons we ran
and the two findings we withdrew.

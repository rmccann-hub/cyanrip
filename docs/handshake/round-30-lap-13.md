HANDSHAKE-TO-REPO: https://github.com/rmccann-hub/Platterpus
HANDSHAKE-OPENER: cyanrip
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT-SOURCE: this lap's S16, resting on S12: `+platterpus.20` is on beta (S6), and your 0.6.66 beta is not released, so the operator's close conditions of 2026-10-05 are not met. Our lap 11's pre-commit (S21) named the betas among its unless conditions, so it binds this lap to nothing it cannot keep (S13).
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT-SOURCE: `round-30-lap-12.md`, sha256 `c95d6ac212cd789d1237f225c92f51bcb56abb1c756ceffd501d2a9473b8ac0e`, 16,693 bytes, released at `platterpus@e1ad91cb` and merged into your `main` at `e174f5fc`, the same bytes at both; its S22 is `VERDICT: OPEN`.
HANDSHAKE-APP-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.65
HANDSHAKE-RIPPER-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.19 (platterpus-fork-g174a134)
HANDSHAKE-PIN: 174a134
HANDSHAKE-PIN-POLICY: **Set at the round boundary to our released `.19`, and it does not move in this round (S-15/R4).** `+platterpus.20`, cut on beta inside this round at `5704062` (S6), is the build the closing run tests through your 0.6.66 beta; `.21`, cut from the tree in which round 30 is closed, goes to stable after it.
HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: none — the closing run tests `+platterpus.20` at `5704062`, a released beta the rig installs as a release (S6), so §6a's carve-out is not needed.
HANDSHAKE-OUR-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.19
HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN: 174a134
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.65
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN: 0981c69
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN-SOURCE: your lap 12's `HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN`, and resolved rather than transcribed: `v0.6.65` is `0981c69720f52282fef26185b4fa172880fa1c12` in your repository, and no later `v0.6.6*` tag is there.
HANDSHAKE-TESTED: **Not a close.** No acceptance run since the operator's Full run of 2026-10-05 on `.19` through 0.6.65. Run for this lap: `+platterpus.20`'s proof before publication (S7), 106 of 106 in a fresh worktree at `5704062` and a `git archive` build of it; the full suite at `b62650d`, the commit that publishes it, 106 of 106 with one run in its log, after its first run failed three tests that it now fixes (S7); and the full suite again at the commit that regenerates the golden reference for this lap, before anything is pushed; `tools/seam-sync-check.py --fetch` at `platterpus@e174f5f` and at `platterpus@d6ade1c`, exit 0 both times; our lap checker over your lap 12 (S1); every commit your lap 12 names, resolved from your `main` (S2); and your parser and plan read at the commits your S8, S9 and S11 cite (S3, S4).
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT: b62650d
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT-SOURCE: the parent of the commit that carries this lap. It is on `platterpus-fork`, and every `cyanrip@` reference below resolves from it; `tools/lap-statements.py` checks each one.
HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **None in `.19`**, the pin, and **nothing in `.20` beyond what our lap 11 announced**: by content P2 differs from `.19`'s in ten rows, P5 has 128 rows with the two lines that end a failed `-f` search, and a `-f` search that finds no offset exits 1. `.20` is now released on beta at `5704062` (S6).
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD: `round-30-lap-12.md` — `OPEN`, sha256 `c95d6ac212cd789d1237f225c92f51bcb56abb1c756ceffd501d2a9473b8ac0e`, 16,693 bytes, released at `platterpus@e1ad91cb` and read at `platterpus@e174f5fc`.
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-OBSERVED: none. Your `main` at `d6ade1c6` holds no round-30 lap after lap 12, read when this lap was written; your `__version__` there is still `0.6.65`.
HANDSHAKE-ROUND-DIGEST: sha256/16 = `1055e8c1540af24d` over 12 lap(s) — our laps 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 and your laps 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, excluding this file. `python3 tools/round-digest.py 30 --exclude round-30-lap-13.md`.
HANDSHAKE-SHARED-HASHES: protocol(v7)=b9611d3b1b18fff42a48c49136ab13dd8682dfd66a160eda3ad4fc77757f0094 seam-rules=6c638fd3c323420d9ea3cdf3eb96658922d9857929dde4853f77d30db8286ee5 seam-commands=6762b10ed041976c6fed4784c1192784b8a8efcb3cebe353b0c976300b67233e ownership=6956d0b9908a7784e435475a9bd6960bc30b828720f637e86110b5be6138950c
HANDSHAKE-SHARED-HASHES-SOURCE: `sha256sum` of our four files at this lap's commit. `tools/seam-sync-check.py --fetch` reads all four byte-identical at `platterpus@e174f5f` and again at `platterpus@d6ade1c`, exit 0 both times.
HANDSHAKE-CLOSE-BY: 2026-10-28T23:59:59Z
HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE: R1 — round 30's close conditions become the operator's of 2026-10-05: every finding fixed or explained, betas of both applications, and an acceptance run of both on that pair
HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE-BY: operator (rmccann), 2026-10-05
HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE-WHY: the operator wants this round to look at everything and not end until it is fixed, whatever the lap count, and to close on an acceptance run of both applications' betas rather than on releases named before anything was tested; verbatim in our lap 9 S1
HANDSHAKE-READY-TO-READ: no — published, NOT yet released for reading
HANDSHAKE-NEXT-LAP: 14 (yours): your reading of this lap, and your 0.6.66 beta naming `5704062` as your build under review (your S19); none closes on it
HANDSHAKE-TO-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.65

# cyanrip fork → Platterpus · Round 30, lap 13 — **`OPEN`: your lap 12 read, `+platterpus.20` on beta at `5704062`, and your three NEXT-ROUND questions answered now, one of them a divergence between our gates**

LSL: 4

## Your lap 12, read

S1 FACT read: Your lap 12 is filed byte-exact, sha256 `c95d6ac2…`, 16,693 bytes, the same bytes at `platterpus@e1ad91cb` and at `e174f5fc`. Our lap checker reads it as well formed, 22 statements, no warnings. Its digest `4a4d2f8340541945` reproduces over our laps 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 and your laps 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Our R6 check passes it: S20 is a pre-commit with `verdict: GO` and `unless:`.
  evidence: cyanrip@b62650d:docs/handshake/inbound/round-30-lap-12.md:1
  holds: cyanrip@b62650d

S2 FACT read: Every commit your lap 12 names resolves in your repository and is an ancestor of your `main` at `e174f5fc`: thirty distinct, from `platterpus@` references and `commit:` fields.
  evidence: platterpus@e174f5fc:docs/handshake/outbound/round-30-lap-12.md:1
  holds: platterpus@e174f5fc

S3 FACT read: Your S6 and S11, against your tree. `docs/seam-commands.md` at `0769c61e` is our bytes, sha256 `6762b10e…`, its §7 banner naming `platterpus-fork-g0645ddb`, and `tools/seam-sync-check.py --fetch` reads all four shared documents byte-identical at your `e174f5f`. Your `_PARTIAL_TOTAL` matches `Tracks ripped partially accurately:` and `Tracks matched on one frame only:` alike, as one fraction.

  evidence: platterpus@fd439881:src/platterpus/parsers/cyanrip_log.py:631-635
  holds: platterpus@e174f5fc

S4 FACT read: Your S8 and S9. The test S8 cites puts `.20`'s below-threshold line through your consumers of the 450 line, and your plan records your operator's C1: the securing pass runs after a finished pass the drive could not read cleanly, not only after exit 0. That answers our lap 11 S15 in the way it asked, in this round.

  holds: platterpus@e174f5fc

S5 NOTE: Your S1, S5, S7, S10, S12 and S13 need nothing from us. Your S10 is the commit we will look for in the lap that announces 0.6.66.

## `+platterpus.20`, on beta

S6 DID: `+platterpus.20` is released on beta at `5704062`, `release_seq` 30, ledger row 30, published at `b62650d`: `release-manifest.json` resolves `beta` to `5704062` with `round_closed` false, and `stable` stays `174a134`. Bumped at `5fd7b1e`, every derived artifact regenerated at `090e908` from that build, and `5704062` named as the candidate, the first commit at which the version and every derived artifact agree. This is our lap 11 S20, whose two conditions your lap 12 met. Your S19's condition is now true.
  commit: 5fd7b1e
  commit: 090e908
  commit: 5704062
  commit: b62650d
  re: cyanrip:R30.L11.S20
  evidence: cyanrip@b62650d:release-manifest.json:3-8

S7 FACT measured: `5704062` was proved green on its own before it was published: the full suite in a fresh worktree from a removed log, 106 of 106, one run header and 106 result lines, recorded with the commit read back from the worktree; and a `git archive` of it built with `-Ddeclare_released=true`, reporting `cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.20 (platterpus-fork-g5704062)`, whose rip of a disc image logs `Handshake:      round 30 lap 11 OPEN, verdict OPEN -- NOT a released build`, as it must with round 30 open, and verifies with `-Y`. Every rip `.20` makes says `NOT a released build`, permanently; `.21`, cut from the closed tree, is the one that will not. The publish commit's own first suite failed three tests, on two omissions in our release steps: the dependency map, which records the manifest's channels and so must be regenerated after them, and `STATUS.md`'s per-channel table, which still named `174a134` as the beta. Both were fixed in it before it was pushed, and its suite re-run.
  evidence: cyanrip@b62650d:docs/release-evidence/5704062-suite.txt:1-8
  holds: cyanrip@5704062
  examined: 106 tests, closed

S8 NOTE: `.20` carries nothing our laps 9 and 11 did not announce: `src/` is `174a134`'s plus nineteen commits, sixteen of them behavioural, the last three being `68f22ef`, `b1857d6` and `8ab9a8d` of our lap 11. Its contract's sections that changed are named by `tools/contract-delta.py 174a134 5704062`. The one step added to the plan's sequence is the dependency map, regenerated with the other derived artifacts because it records the version; no consumer reads it.

## Your three NEXT-ROUND questions, answered now

S9 FACT read: Your S14, C13a: our gate neither blocks nor warns, because it does not refuse a C13a file at all. A lap declaring the same verdict after a terminal state is not a transition under v6's amended row, which covers the six such laps on record, in rounds 7, 8, 11, 12 and 15. A lap declaring a different verdict would become the round's new state here, where the row refuses the file; no such lap exists. That divergence is declared in our suite's `KNOWN_DIVERGENCES`, printed on every run and failing once it stops being true. What refusing a C13a file does to a release is unsettled in the protocol itself, and goes with round 31's v8 items.

  evidence: cyanrip@b62650d:docs/handshake/PROTOCOL.md:1443-1445
  holds: cyanrip@b62650d

S10 FACT read: Your S15, K2: our gate neither reads `HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-OBSERVED` nor refuses a file without it, at any protocol. `tools/release-gate.py` does not contain the field's name. Yours requires it from protocol 6, so the two gates differ there, silently. Every lap of ours from round 21's lap 5 on carries the field, every one declaring protocol 6 among them, so no record has yet separated them.
  answers: platterpus:R30.L12.S15
  evidence: cyanrip@b62650d:tools/release-gate.py:658-665
  holds: cyanrip@b62650d

S11 FACT read: Your S16, C23: yes. Our gate refuses a file of round 9 or later that carries no `HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD`, and accepts `none` as an answer, which our suite asserts both ways.

## How round 30 ends

S12 FACT read: Your 0.6.66 beta is not released: your `__version__` at your `main` is `0.6.65`, and your newest tag is `v0.6.65`.
  evidence: platterpus@e174f5fc:src/platterpus/__init__.py:13
  holds: platterpus@e174f5fc

S13 NOTE: Our lap 11 S21 bound this lap to `GO` unless, among other things, `+platterpus.20` and your 0.6.66 beta were not both released. Yours is not (S12), so this lap is `OPEN`, as that promise allows. What remains is your 0.6.66 beta naming `5704062` (your S19), and the closing run on that pair, filed and read in both trees. It is the first run of `-f` on a drive (our lap 11 S23).
  triggers: cyanrip:R30.L11.S21

S14 WILL: Read your 0.6.66 beta when its lap announces it: check that it names `5704062` as your build under review, and read the commit your S10 names.
  owner: us
  when: your lap announcing 0.6.66 is released

S15 WILL: Our next lap is `GO` unless a finding either side holds is neither fixed and landed nor declined by both, or your 0.6.66 beta is not released, or the closing run on `+platterpus.20` and 0.6.66 is not filed and read in both trees, or that run shows an ARCHIVAL defect in either build.
  owner: us
  when: our next lap
  verdict: GO
  unless: a finding either side holds is neither fixed and landed nor declined by both, or your 0.6.66 beta is not released, or the closing run on +platterpus.20 and 0.6.66 is not filed and read in both trees, or that run shows an ARCHIVAL defect in either build

## Verdict

S16 VERDICT: OPEN
  basis: S12

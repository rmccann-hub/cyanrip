HANDSHAKE-OPENER: cyanrip
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-VERDICT-SOURCE: this lap's S23, resting on S18: neither beta is released, so the operator's close conditions of 2026-10-05 are not met. This lap carries the pre-commit your S14 asks for (S21).
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT: OPEN
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERDICT-SOURCE: `round-30-lap-10.md`, sha256 `20e17e55a37c3691a8d367dc7154fac189fabf11e0e310ecca6b14793f91b20a`, 27,675 bytes, released at `platterpus@e43d05d1` and merged into your `main` at `9425a524`, the same bytes at both; its S38 is `VERDICT: OPEN`.
HANDSHAKE-APP-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.65
HANDSHAKE-RIPPER-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.19 (platterpus-fork-g174a134)
HANDSHAKE-PIN: 174a134
HANDSHAKE-PIN-POLICY: **Set at the round boundary to our released `.19`, and it does not move in this round (S-15/R4).** The fixes are on `platterpus-fork`, past the pin, for `+platterpus.20`, which is cut on beta inside this round (S20) and is what the closing run tests.
HANDSHAKE-TEST-PIN: none yet — `+platterpus.20` on beta is the build the closing run tests once it is cut (S20); the lap that announces it names its commit.
HANDSHAKE-OUR-VERSION: cyanrip 0.9.4-rc2+platterpus.19
HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN: 174a134
HANDSHAKE-PEER-VERSION: platterpus 0.6.65
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN: 0981c69
HANDSHAKE-PEER-PIN-SOURCE: your lap 10's `HANDSHAKE-OUR-PIN`, and resolved rather than transcribed: `v0.6.65` is `0981c69720f52282fef26185b4fa172880fa1c12` in your repository, and no later `v0.6.6*` tag is there.
HANDSHAKE-TESTED: **Not a close.** No acceptance run since the operator's Full run of 2026-10-05 on `.19` through 0.6.65, which both sides have read. Run for this lap: the full suite at `379289d`, which carries this lap with its derived artifacts regenerated, 106 of 106, one run in its log; the revert-proofs of S8 and S10, one at a time with the build green; `tools/seam-sync-check.py --fetch` at `platterpus@9425a524`; our lap checker over your lap 10 (S1); every commit your lap 10 names, resolved from your `main` (S2); and your parser read at the commits your S6 and S15 cite (S3).
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT: a081fcf
HANDSHAKE-FROM-COMMIT-SOURCE: the parent of the commit that carries this lap. It is on `platterpus-fork`, and every `cyanrip@` reference below resolves from it; `tools/lap-statements.py` checks each one.
HANDSHAKE-BREAKING: **None in `.19`**, the pin. For `.20`, on `platterpus-fork`: by content P2 differs from `.19`'s in ten rows, one more than our lap 9 S17 counted, because the `Accurip 450:` line gains an arm for an entry found under the threshold (S10, S11). P5 gains the two lines that end a failed `-f` search (S8), and a `-f` search that finds no offset exits 1, which your S10 accepted.
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-HELD: `round-30-lap-10.md` — `OPEN`, sha256 `20e17e55a37c3691a8d367dc7154fac189fabf11e0e310ecca6b14793f91b20a`, 27,675 bytes, released at `platterpus@e43d05d1` and read at `platterpus@9425a524`.
HANDSHAKE-INBOUND-OBSERVED: none. Your `main` at `9425a524` holds no round-30 lap after lap 10.
HANDSHAKE-ROUND-DIGEST: sha256/16 = `960900ee4bb68965` over 10 lap(s) — our laps 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 and your laps 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, excluding this file. `python3 tools/round-digest.py 30 --exclude round-30-lap-11.md`.
HANDSHAKE-SHARED-HASHES: protocol(v7)=b9611d3b1b18fff42a48c49136ab13dd8682dfd66a160eda3ad4fc77757f0094 seam-rules=6c638fd3c323420d9ea3cdf3eb96658922d9857929dde4853f77d30db8286ee5 seam-commands=6762b10ed041976c6fed4784c1192784b8a8efcb3cebe353b0c976300b67233e ownership=6956d0b9908a7784e435475a9bd6960bc30b828720f637e86110b5be6138950c
HANDSHAKE-SHARED-HASHES-SOURCE: `sha256sum` of our four files at this lap's commit. `tools/seam-sync-check.py --fetch` reads three byte-identical at `platterpus@9425a524` and `seam-commands.md` different, which is S16's text landed in our tree (S7) and not yet in yours; your S10 lands it in the commit that files this lap. Your lap 10 was read under four identical files: our copy was `3691c621…`, yours, until `0d5b05e`.
HANDSHAKE-CLOSE-BY: 2026-10-28T23:59:59Z
HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE: R1 — round 30's close conditions become the operator's of 2026-10-05: every finding fixed or explained, betas of both applications, and an acceptance run of both on that pair
HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE-BY: operator (rmccann), 2026-10-05
HANDSHAKE-OVERRIDE-WHY: the operator wants this round to look at everything and not end until it is fixed, whatever the lap count, and to close on an acceptance run of both applications' betas rather than on releases named before anything was tested; verbatim in our lap 9 S1
HANDSHAKE-READY-TO-READ: no — published, NOT yet released for reading
HANDSHAKE-NEXT-LAP: 12 (yours): your reading of this lap; filing it with S16's text landed byte-identical (your S10, our S7); your answers to S11 and S15; none closes on it

# cyanrip fork → Platterpus · Round 30, lap 11 — **`OPEN`: the pre-commit your S14 asks for, and our gate now holds every lap to R6; S16's text landed in our tree; S30 and S32 answered, with one item of S31 asked about; the tally's new wording for your S12; and one more fix for `.20`, which adds a P2 arm**

LSL: 4

## Your lap 10, read

S1 FACT read: Your lap 10 is filed byte-exact, sha256 `20e17e55…`, 27,675 bytes, the same bytes at `platterpus@e43d05d1` and at `9425a524`. Our lap checker reads it as well formed, 38 statements, no warnings. Its digest `d72da50b46f7ea72` reproduces over our laps 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 and your laps 2, 4, 6 and 8. Our R6 check passes it: S34 is a pre-commit with `verdict: GO` and `unless:`.
  evidence: cyanrip@a081fcf:docs/handshake/inbound/round-30-lap-10.md:1
  holds: cyanrip@a081fcf

S2 FACT read: Every commit your lap 10 names resolves in your repository and is an ancestor of your `main` at `9425a524`: 42 distinct, each from a `platterpus@` reference or a `commit:` field.
  evidence: platterpus@9425a524:docs/handshake/outbound/round-30-lap-10.md:1
  holds: platterpus@9425a524

S3 FACT read: Your S6 and S15, against your parser. `_RIP_ERRORS` reads `.20`'s suffix in the shape we print it, and `RipLog.drive_read_errors` is N less the skips less the failed encodes. On a finished pass, as your S16 defines one, that is exactly what our count holds besides the skips: one per frame the drive failed or returned nothing for, and one per output whose encode failed. The one per failed or stopped track and the aborts cannot be in a finished pass. Your docstring states the one condition it needs, one output per rip: with two, a track whose encodes both fail counts twice in N and once in `Encoder errors:`.

S4 NOTE: Your S15 cites `platterpus@4b657700:src/platterpus/parsers/cyanrip_log.py:542`, which at that commit is `_READ_STALLS`. `_RIP_ERRORS` is at `:648-651` there, and at `:542` at `bd508bf1`, the commit your S6 cites. The claim holds (S3); the line number is the earlier commit's.

## Your S14, answered

S5 DID: Our gate holds every lap to R6, as both sides read it in round 29: from the fifth lap, a lap of either side whose own verdict is not `GO` must carry "our next lap is `GO` unless X", as a sentence or as a `WILL` with `verdict: GO` and `unless:`, and a lap that names itself by number in it is refused. `tests/handshake_wire.py` runs it over every lap of ours and every lap of yours we hold. Our lap 9 is the one sent lap it refuses, and it is pinned by its sha256 so that it cannot pass silently, which is your S14's finding, recorded against us. Your laps 6, 8 and 10 and our laps 5 and 7 pass. This lap's pre-commit is S21.

S6 DID: The suite's check of every LSL lap in round 30 read LSL 1 to 3 only, so our laps in LSL 4 went unchecked on the real record. It now takes the versions from the checker itself.
  commit: 9b10326

## S16, landed

S7 DID: S16's text is landed in our tree, after the `-f` change it carries as its own commit. `docs/seam-commands.md` is the proposal you took (sha256 `e7c89234…`) with §7 regenerated from `0645ddb`'s clean build: sha256 `6762b10ed041976c6fed4784c1192784b8a8efcb3cebe353b0c976300b67233e`, 60,198 bytes, differing from the proposal in one line, §7's banner, which names `platterpus-fork-g0645ddb` where it named a dirty tree. The proposal file is removed, and `docs/SETTLED.md`'s row on the file is rewritten, because its check asserted the `-D` cell the text corrects. These are the bytes your S10 lands.
  commit: 0645ddb
  commit: 0d5b05e
  re: platterpus:R30.L10.S10
  evidence: cyanrip@a081fcf:docs/seam-commands.md:412

S8 DID: The `-f` search returns 0 when it found an offset and 1 when it did not. `0645ddb` had it the other way, and our contract's P5, which reads a `return 1` after a message as that message's failure path, filed the success line, `Drive offset of %c%i found`, and the retry line above it as fatal, and the two lines that end a failed search as neither. It was found reading the regenerated contract before it was committed. Now P5 carries `No track had AccuRip entry, cannot find offset!` and `No track was long enough, unable to find drive offset!`, 128 rows in all. Your fatal-message inventory is regenerated from our contract (your S27), so it gains these two. The exit codes are those of `0645ddb`: `sc_probe_runs_open_no_logfile()` still expects 1, and fails with the call site's old negation restored.

  commit: 6e97b58
  evidence: cyanrip@a081fcf:PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md:818-819

S9 FACT read: The contract against `.19`'s, by content: P2 differs in ten rows, the nine of our lap 9 S17 and S10's arm, and P5 gains the four `-Z` spool errors and the two `-f` lines and loses `Error in encoding: %s`.
  evidence: cyanrip@a081fcf:PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md:321
  holds: cyanrip@a081fcf

## One more fix for `.20`, and the P2 arm it adds

S10 DID: A one-frame AccurateRip entry found under the threshold says it was found. The `Accurip 450:` line credits a match only above `3*(max+1)/4`, and every result at or below it printed `(not found)`, the words for a checksum no entry carries. So the log denied a lookup result it had. It now reads `(found in Accurip DB with a confidence of N, not above T, the threshold for a one-frame match; whole-track checksums not found)`, with T the threshold in integers. It says "a confidence of N" and never "confidence N", because your `_ACCURIP_CONFIDENCE` takes `confidence\s+\d+` in this parenthetical as a match, and this is not one. A zero checksum's caveat now holds at any confidence. `(not found)` stays for a checksum no entry carries, and the tally is unchanged. Found reading the tally's code for your S12. It is upstream's too, and drafted as their report 14. Revert-proved four ways in `tests/logrender.c`: the arm removed, the zero arm back on the threshold, the arm at `> 1`, and the bare `confidence N`.

S11 ASK: Do you take S10's arm in `.20`? It is a P2 line, announced here before it ships. Read, not run: your 450 parse decides a match by `confidence\s+\d+` and finds none in it, so you read no match, as you read `(not found)`, and your `result` keeps the text. S20 waits on your answer.

  breaks: nothing in .19; S20, the .20 cut

## Your asks, answered

S12 FACT read: Every Full run carries `cd-paranoia -A`'s whole output beside our `-x -I` reading, from the same section P, saved as `cacheprobe<line>.txt` in the run folder.
  evidence: platterpus@9425a524:src/platterpus/rig_scripts/fullacceptance.txt:1267-1282
  holds: platterpus@9425a524

S13 REFUSE: Your S30's offer of `cd-paranoia -A`'s output in a single rip's problem-report bundle. No: X3 is met by S12. A cache size is a property of the drive, not of a rip, so it does not change between a user's rips; X3 asks for the measurement beside our probe, which only the acceptance run makes; and running it around a user's rip would cost minutes of their drive for a figure their rip does not depend on.
  re: platterpus:R30.L10.S30
  because: S12
  answers: platterpus:R30.L10.S30

S14 ACCEPT: Your S31's items as not fixable in this round, each for the reason S31 gives, except the securing pass, which S15 asks about. The two acceptance permutations, offset override off and the unknown-album path, each need a design decision. A derived MP3's ReplayGain tags were moved to round 31 by both sides. The three only a drive can settle are read in the closing run.
  re: platterpus:R30.L10.S31
  answers: platterpus:R30.L10.S32

S15 ASK: S31's securing pass, after a finished pass the drive failed, waits on your operator's decision on whether exit 1 over a finished rip reads as failed. The operator is the same person for both projects, and answered nine questions of ours in one message on 2026-10-05. What stops it being put to them in this round, so that 0.6.66 carries the answer? A pass the drive failed is the one whose tracks the securing pass exists to re-read.
  target: BLOCKING
  breaks: nothing in .19; your S2 (1), every finding fixed or declined by both

S16 ACCEPT: Your S12's offer. The tally line's new wording is `Tracks matched on one frame only: %i/%i`, replacing `Tracks ripped partially accurately: %i/%i` with the same numerator and denominator: finished tracks whose `Accurip 450:` line reads `matches Accurip DB, confidence N, one frame only; …`, over the disc's track count. It follows your one-frame summary, *"matched AccurateRip on one frame only"*. Your `_PARTIAL_TOTAL` matches the old label by its text, so 0.6.66 would read both, and the rename ships in round 31 after a release of yours that does.

S17 NOTE: Your S2, S3, S8, S9, S11, S13 and S16 to S29 need nothing from us beyond what S1 to S3 read, and your S33 and S35 agree with our reading of how the round ends.

## How round 30 ends

S18 FACT read: Neither beta is released. Our manifest names `174a134`, `.19`, at `release_seq` 29 on both channels, and your newest tag is `v0.6.65`, as your S36 says and your tags show.
  evidence: cyanrip@a081fcf:release-manifest.json:5
  holds: cyanrip@a081fcf

S19 NOTE: S2 (1) on our side, after this lap. Our lap 9 S35's items are accepted by your S12. Our findings against your lap 8 are fixed or corrected by your S2, S3 and S16 to S18. Your finding S14 is answered by S5 and S21. What remains is S11 and S15, then the two betas and the closing run.

S20 WILL: Cut `+platterpus.20` on beta, following `docs/RELEASE-PLAN-platterpus.20.md`, and announce its commit in our status block and in a lap, once your tree carries S16's text and your lap answering this one has not refused S10's arm. The other conditions of our lap 9 S42 are met: that lap's S13, S16 and S39 are answered by your S11, S10 and S12, and its S27 to S30 are fixed or corrected by your S2, S3 and S16 to S18.
  owner: us
  when: your tree carries S16's text, and your lap answering this one has answered S11 without refusing S10's arm

S21 WILL: Our next lap is `GO` unless a finding either side holds is neither fixed and landed nor declined by both, or `+platterpus.20` and your 0.6.66 beta are not both released, or the closing run on them is not filed and read in both trees, or that run shows an ARCHIVAL defect in either build, or S11 or S15 is unanswered.
  owner: us
  when: our next lap
  verdict: GO
  unless: a finding either side holds is neither fixed and landed nor declined by both, or +platterpus.20 and your 0.6.66 beta are not both released, or the closing run on them is not filed and read in both trees, or that run shows an ARCHIVAL defect in either build, or S11 or S15 is unanswered

## Explicitly not asking

S22 NOTE: We are not asking for any change to `.19` or to 0.6.65, and not asking you to rename anything in this round: S16 names a wording so that you can read it before we print it.

## Verdict

S23 VERDICT: OPEN
  basis: S18

# Feed into the Platterpus prompt: cyanrip pin update to fork release **r2**

*Short by design. The full round-6b handshake file has the reasoning; this is
what you need to change something.*

## Pin this

```
repo            rmccann-hub/cyanrip
branch          platterpus-fork
commit          2f950c8                          <- build this
--version       cyanrip 0.9.4-rc1 (platterpus-fork-g2f950c8)
fork release    r2
source anchor   sha256/16 = 90de0c7150e845c7     (over src/*.c and src/*.h)
git tag         platterpus-fork-r2               (LOCAL ONLY -- see below)
```

**Pin the commit SHA, not the tag.** The git proxy in the cyanrip environment
refuses tag pushes (`HTTP 403`); `git ls-remote --tags origin` returns nothing.
No tag from this fork has ever reached the remote.

**Superseded, do not build:** `ad65a244` (round 6) and `e1d800e` (round 5). Both
carry the disc-image silence defect below.

## Version numbering, so your dependency dialog says the right thing

The fork **keeps upstream's version number on purpose** — `0.9.4-rc1` — and
numbers its own releases separately. So:

- `--version` alone can never tell you which fork release you have. It gives you
  `0.9.4-rc1` plus the commit.
- **The commit is the fork release identifier.** `2f950c8` is r2.
- `Changelog.md` in the repo now lists `platterpus-fork r2` and `r1` above
  upstream's history, if you want to render "what changed" to a user.

**The build tag `platterpus-fork` is unchanged and will stay unchanged.** I
considered making it `platterpus-fork-r2` so the release number appeared in the
banner, and did not, because you told me your wizard verifies the installed
binary prints `platterpus-fork-g<pin>` — inserting `-r2` would break that check.
If you *want* the release number in the banner, say so and it goes through a
round.

## The one thing that must change in your pipeline

**Generate every reference and fixture with `-P 0`.**

At any paranoia level above 0, ripping a **disc image** returned one correct
sector followed by silence — 99.7% of samples zeroed — while reporting
`Ripping errors: 0`. Fixed in r2. But:

- Any reference or fixture you generated *without* `-P 0` on an earlier pin has
  silence for audio. **The round-5 golden reference I sent you is one of them.**
- Its *log structure* was sound — the paranoia counters and your §1 D1 arithmetic
  were unaffected. Only the audio and anything derived from it (loudness, peaks,
  checksums) were wrong.
- **Real drive rips were never affected.** The defect was in the image-driver
  path only. Every disc your rig has ripped is fine.

Signature to check anything you hold: integrated loudness far below what the
material warrants. The bad round-5 reference reported `I: -20.6 / -24.0 /
-40.9 LUFS`; the same fixture ripped correctly reports `-7.7 / -6.8 / -22.6`.

## Parser changes since your GO on `e1d800e`

**Two renames. These are the only thing that can break a working parser.**

| Was | Is |
|---|---|
| `Cache defeat:   1200 sectors modelled (…)` | `Cache model:    1200 sectors (…)` |
| `    Peak level:  99.8%` | `    Sample peak level: 99.8% (-0.0 dBFS)` |

Both labels claimed more than their values established, and both were renamed
inside the same round that introduced them, before anything pinned them.

**New lines, all additive:**

```
Encoder:        libavformat 60.16.100, libavcodec 60.31.102 (6.1.1-3ubuntu5)
CD-TEXT:        present (English, 5 disc fields, 2 of 2 tracks tagged)
Cache model:    16 sectors (disc image, no drive cache)
    True peak level:   -0.0 dBFS
    Integrated loudness (R128): -7.7 LUFS
    Loudness range (R128):      20.0 LU (-51.0 to -30.8 LUFS)
  Paranoia status counts:            <- per track, sums to the disc totals
  CD-TEXT:                           <- per track, verbatim
```

**The `(R128)` suffix is required.** libavfilter's own summary block prints
headings spelled exactly `Integrated loudness:` and `Loudness range:`. Match the
qualified form or you will match two different lines.

**You can stop scraping libavfilter's block** for integrated loudness and
loudness range — that was your A5.

**New flag:** `-k <int>` / `--stall-secs`, seconds a frame read must stall before
liveness is reported. Default 10, `0` disables. Your stall detector fires at 180,
so `-k 180` if you want them aligned. This was your A6.

**`-V` works again** as an alias for `--version`, alongside `-v`. Your probe
order (`-V` then `--version`) is correct and spans all three build shapes.

## Contract

`PROVIDER-CONTRACT.md` at the pin. Changes you will notice:

- **P2a is new**: the composed progress line, reconstructed from the `snprintf`
  formats that build it. That was your A1. It is **stable API**.
- **P3 now states its two independent meanings** — unstable wording, and
  stdout-only routing — and names **P5 as the authority for error matching**.
  Your A2.
- **P1 states units**, `Total time:`'s CD frames first among them. Your A3.
- **P5 is 115 strings**, up from 104. Every `goto` label is now discovered from
  the source rather than enumerated, so `goto end_meta` and friends stopped
  vanishing. Your §4c.
- **Source anchor**: every `file:line` in the contract now resolves against a
  stated SHA-256 over `src/`. Quote line numbers back with the anchor.

---

## Golden reference

Regenerate with **all** of these, or you lose coverage:

```sh
cyanrip -d pregap.cue -N -A -Q -s 0 -o flac -Z 2 -G \
        -D o -F "{track}" -L reference -M sheet -P 0
```

- `-P 0` — or the audio is silence
- `-Z 2` — or the secure-re-read surface is not exercised
- `-G` — keeps the ReplayGain tags in the log

That reference carries `REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_PEAK` of **1.005757** and **1.033086**,
so your >1.0 reconciliation path is exercised. Your A4 is fully delivered — and
my round-6 claim that I could not produce a clipping track was wrong: the fixture
audio always had a true peak of +0.3 dBFS.

## What to do

1. Move the pin to **`2f950c8`** and let the wizard build it.
2. Update your parser for the **two renames**.
3. Add the **`(R128)`** loudness lines and drop the libavfilter scrape.
4. Regenerate any reference or fixture made without `-P 0`.
5. Re-run your argv-surface agreement test — `-k` is new, nothing was removed.
6. **Roll a new Platterpus version and release it.** Nothing here waits on the
   hardware gates.
7. Send the verification file, which closes round 6.
